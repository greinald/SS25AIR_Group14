This repository was used to structure our **pipeline for the BioASQ competition**. Please note that some large files (e.g., models and large retrieval results) are not included here due to repository size limitations.
**To ensure full reproducibility, we have provided these files on Google Drive:**

### Architectural Overview

This repository is organized following a two-phase pipeline:

<img width="691" alt="System_Architecture" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e28d00f-fc60-4150-93e4-342986dd9975" /> <p align="center" style="color:gray"> <i>Figure: High-level architecture of the BioASQ pipeline implemented in this repository.<br> Phase A handles document retrieval and ranking. Phase B processes the ranked results through question-specific agents to generate answers.</i> </p>


Please see the main notebook (`AIR_Code.ipynb`) for a pipeline overview and usage instructions.




## Final Remarks

With this project our main goal was not only pure performance but rather create a pipeline which is easly replicatable and workable from others in future work. We tried to create a system which is easly understandable and tried to visualize that with the diagram above. This should make it easy for anyone to follow our work or even make it better.

**Note:** The API was non functional on the day of the subbmition(29.05.2025) but we hope that it will work when you try to run it. Thank you.
