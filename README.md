# SS25AIR\_Group14 (Machinen Results in the Test Batch 4)

This repository was used to structure our **pipeline for the BioASQ competition**. Please note that some large files (e.g., models and large retrieval results) are not included here due to repository size limitations.
**To ensure full reproducibility, we have provided these files on Google Drive:**

### Architectural Overview

This repository is organized following a two-phase pipeline:

* **Phase A:** Retrieval and ranking (BM25, NLP representations, neural reranking)
* **Phase B:** Question-specific agents for answer generation (Yes/No, Factoid/List, Summary)

See the main notebook (`AIR_Code.ipynb`) for a pipeline overview and usage instructions.
