# SS25AIR_Group14(Machinen Results in the Test Batch 4)

This repository was used to structure our **pipeline for the BioASQ competition**. Please note that some large files (e.g., models and large retrieval results) are not included here due to repository size limitations. **To ensure full reproducibility, we have provided these files on Google Drive:**
