          "abstract": "Zotiraciclib (TG02) is an oral multi-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor thought to inhibit tumor growth via CDK-9-dependent depletion of survival proteins such as c-MYC and MCL-1 which are frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma. EORTC 1608 (NCT03224104) (STEAM) had a three parallel group (A,B,C) phase Ib, open-label, non-randomized, multicenter design in IDH wild-type newly diagnosed glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma. Groups A and B explored the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TG02 in elderly patients, in combination with hypofractionated radiotherapy alone (group A) or temozolomide alone (group B), according to O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation status determined centrally. Group C explored single agent activity of TG02 at first relapse after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy with a primary endpoint of progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6). Tumor expression of CDK-9, c-MYC and MCL-1 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The MTD was 150 mg twice weekly in combination with radiotherapy alone (group A) or temozolomide alone (group B). Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed at 150 mg: one in group A (grade 3 seizure), one in group B (multiple grade 1 events). Main toxicities included neutropenia, gastrointestinal disorders and hepatotoxicity. PFS-6 in group C was 6.7%. CDK-9, c-MYC and MCL-1 were confirmed to be expressed and their expression was moderately cross-correlated. High protein levels of MCL-1 were associated with inferior survival. TG02 exhibits overlapping toxicity with alkylating agents and low single agent clinical activity in recurrent glioblastoma. The role of CDK-9 and its down-stream effectors as prognostic factors and therapeutic targets in glioblastoma warrants further study."

          "abstract": "To determine the effects of antiepileptic drug compounds on glioblastoma cellular growth, we exposed glioblastoma cell lines to select antiepileptic drugs. The effects of selected antiepileptic drugs on glioblastoma cells were measured by MTT assay. For compounds showing significant inhibition, cell cycle analysis was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. The antiepileptic compounds selected for screening included carbamazepine, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, magnesium sulfate, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, primidone, tiagabine, topiramate, valproic acid, and vigabatrin. Dexamethasone and temozolomide were used as a negative and positive control respectively. Our results showed temozolomide and oxcarbazepine significantly inhibited glioblastoma cell growth and reached IC50 at therapeutic concentrations. The other antiepileptic drugs screened were unable to reach IC50 at therapeutic concentrations. The metabolites of oxcarbazepine were also unable to reach IC50. Dexamethasone, ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and vigabatrin showed some growth enhancement though they did not reach statistical significance. The growth enhancement effects of ethosuximide, levetiracetam, and vigabatrin found in the study may indicate that these compounds should not be used for prophylaxis or short term treatment of epilepsy in glioblastoma. While valproic acid and oxcarbazepine were effective, the required dose of valproic acid was far above that used for the treatment of epilepsy and the metabolites of oxcarbazepine failed to reach significant growth inhibition ruling out the use of oral oxcarbazepine or valproic acid as monotherapy in glioblastoma. The possibility of using these compounds as local treatment is a future area of study."

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma is an incurable cancer with limited treatment options and a low survival rate. Temozolomide is the standard marketed small-molecule agent for glioblastoma therapy; therefore, we aimed to find new drugs among the marketed medicines for brain diseases because of their cerebral migratory property and found lomerizine, used for the treatment of migraine. We evaluated the effect of lomerizine and its metabolites against U251 glioblastoma cells and temozolomide-resistant cells, T98G and GB-1, caused by the expression of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase or P-glycoprotein, compared with temozolomide, and combined with it. The mechanism of action was investigated using inhibitors of necrosis or apoptosis. Lomerizine and its metabolite (M6) inhibited the proliferation of glioblastoma cells with greater potency and efficacy than temozolomide, including against temozolomide-resistant cells. The effects of lomerizine and M6 on glioblastoma were mainly attributed to the inhibition of proliferation because cells were not rescued by cell death inhibitors, such as necrosis or apoptosis inhibitors, although they were slightly rescued by necrostatin-1. Additionally, lomerizine and M6 combined with temozolomide were more effective at inhibiting the proliferation of U251 and GB-1 cells at some doses than single treatments. Lomerizine has been used for migraine treatment because of its brain-penetrating properties without serious side-effects; thus, it might potentially be expected to be used alone for glioblastoma, including temozolomide-resistant glioblastoma, or in combination with temozolomide."

Current treatments for glioblastoma patients consist of surgery followed by radiation in combination with temozolomide. Despite therapeutic advances, the prognosis for glioblastoma patients remains grim, with a five-year overall survival below 15%. In this study, our team analyzed the interaction between temozolomide and doxorubicin in a glioblastoma cell line, <i>in vitro</i>. The cell line, established from a patient who underwent surgery at the \"Bagdasar Arseni Emergency Hospital\", was exposed to 10 µM and 100 µM of temozolomide and 10 nM and 100 nM of doxorubicin, respectively, over a period of 7, 10 and 14 days, in monotherapy and in combination. The results showed that both temozolomide (66.5% cytotoxicity for the 10 µM dose at 14 days) de and doxorubicin (66.8% cytotoxicity for the 10 nM dose after 14 days) were very effective in killing cancer cells in monotherapy, but failed to produce a synergistic effect when used in combination. While the results may be discouraging, they present an interesting prospect into how certain drug interactions can impact treatment response."

          "abstract": "Temozolomide, used for anaplastic gliomas and glioblastoma multiforme, is an oral drug that is stable under acidic, but labile under neutral and basic conditions. Although the bioavailability of temozolomide is approximately 100%, pathology or anatomical changes of the gastrointestinal tract may adversely affect absorption, and consequently therapeutic response. HPLC-UV was used to evaluate temozolomide plasma pharmacokinetics in a patient with unresponsive glioblastoma multiforme who had previously undergone gastric bypass as part of a weight-loss strategy. Temozolomide plasma pharmacokinetics were comparable to values reported for patients with normal gastrointestinal anatomy. These data imply that progression of disease in this patient was not due to inadequate temozolomide concentrations. Physicians need to become aware of the rapidly increasing population of patients who have had a gastric bypass and require oral therapy, of which our case is representative. The effect of gastric bypass on pharmacokinetics will need to be evaluated on a drug-by-drug basis."

Although bevacizumab has been used successfully in treating cerebral radiation necrosis, there has yet not any report on that apatinib can treat pseudoprogression with symptoms. Here we report a case of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patient with pseudoprogression after receiving the concurrent chemoradiotherapy, which was successfully treated by apatinib. A 51-year-old woman had multiple intracranial lesions (left parietal and right frontal), the primary left parietal lesion was surgically removed and was pathologically confirmed as glioblastoma (WHO grade IV). Then the patient received postoperative temozolomide with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Three weeks after the radiotherapy, the patient experienced increased intracranial pressure and seizure. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 enhancement examination showed an increase of abnormal enhancement range in the area of irradiation. After multiple disciplinary team (MDT) discussion, the patient was diagnosed with pseudoprogression after radiotherapy. Then she was given apatinib for 8 weeks at a dose of 500 mg qd. During the treatment period, the clinical symptoms and corresponding nerve images of the patient have been rapidly improved. In 12 months after the radiotherapy, progression of tumor in the primary site has not been discovered. Apatinib showed a good therapeutic effect and tolerance for the development of pseudoprogression advances with obvious symptoms."

          "abstract": "The treatment of glioblastomas requires a multidisciplinary approach that takes the presently incurable nature of the disease into consideration. Treatments are multimodal and include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Current recommendations are that patients with glioblastomas should undergo maximum surgical resection, followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the novel alkylating drug temozolomide. This is then to be followed by additional adjuvant temozolomide for a period of up to 6 months. Major advances in surgical and imaging technologies used to treat glioblastoma patients are described. These technologies include magnetic resonance imaging and metabolic data that are helpful in the diagnosis and guiding of surgical resection. However, glioblastomas almost invariably recur near their initial sites. Disease progression usually occurs within 6 months and leads rapidly to death. A number of signaling pathways can be activated constitutively in migrating glioma cells, thus rendering these cells resistant to proapoptotic insults, such as conventional chemotherapies. Therefore, the molecular and cellular therapies and local drug delivery that could be used to complement conventional treatments are described, and some of the currently ongoing clinical trials are reviewed, with respect to these new approaches."

Current recommendations are that patients with glioblastoma should undergo maximum surgical resection followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating drug temozolomide, followed subsequently by additional adjuvant temozolomide for a period of up to 6 months. Temozolomide mechanism of action is complex and we have recently evidenced a temozolomide-associated anti-angiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo on preclinical human glioblastoma models. We describe in the current review the temozolomide-associated antiangiogenic activity. We also describe here the major signaling pathways that can be constitutively activated in migrating glioma cells, and which render these cells resistant to proapoptotic insults such as conventional chemotherapies. In light of this resistance, we therefore describe the targeted therapies and local drug delivery systems which could be used to complement conventional treatments. We have reviewed more than 400 ongoing clinical trials with respect to these new targeted therapy approaches alone or in combination for glioblastoma therapy and we also emphasize the importance of vaccinotherapy. We conclude our review with a therapeutic model that could be used in the light of the present knowledge."

          "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma. This tumor type synthesizes the antioxidant glutathione through system X c (-) , which is inhibited by sulfasalazine (SAS). We exposed A172 and T98G human glioblastoma cells to a presumably clinically relevant concentration of TMZ (25 µM) and/or 0.5 mM SAS for 1, 3, or 5 days and assessed cell viability. For both cell lines, TMZ alone did not alter viability at any time point, while the coadministration of TMZ and SAS significantly reduced cell viability after 5 days. The drug combination exerted a synergistic effect on A172 cells after 3 and 5 days. Therefore, this particular lineage was subjected to complementary analyses on the genetic (transcriptome) and functional (glutathione and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) protein) levels. Cellular pathways containing differentially expressed genes related to the cell cycle were modified by TMZ alone. On the other hand, SAS regulated pathways associated with glutathione metabolism and synthesis, irrespective of TMZ. Moreover, SAS, but not TMZ, depleted the total glutathione level. Compared with the vehicle-treated cells, the level of PCNA protein was lower in cells treated with TMZ alone or in combination with SAS. In conclusion, our data showed that the association of TMZ and SAS is cytotoxic to T98G and A172 cells, thus providing useful insights for improving TMZ clinical efficacy through testing this novel drug combination. Moreover, the present study not only reports original information on differential gene expression in glioblastoma cells exposed to TMZ and/or SAS but also describes an antiproliferative effect of TMZ, which has not yet been observed in A172 cells."

High-resolution CT scanning of the chest is the preferred means of establishing the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. With the increasing use of antibiotics in the treatment of childhood infection in the last several decades, an increasing percentage of patients with bronchiectasis now have an underlying disorder that predisposes them to chronic or recurrent infection. These include cystic fibrosis, common variable immunodeficiency, HIV infection, primary ciliary dyskinesia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and chronic Mycobacterium avium complex infection. A variety of agents have been used to improve cough effectiveness and prevent infectious exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis, with variable results. Chest physiotherapy offers a modest benefit in increasing sputum volume, but its long-term effectiveness is unknown. Selected patients with localized idiopathic bronchiectasis that causes intolerable symptoms despite maximal medical therapy should be offered treatment with surgery.

          "abstract": "Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, elicits rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Accumulating evidence suggests that gut microbiota via the gut-brain axis play a role in the pathogenesis of depression, thereby contributing to the antidepressant actions of certain compounds. Here we investigated the role of gut microbiota in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model of depression. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the increased immobility time in forced swimming test (FST), which was associated with the improvements in α-diversity, consisting of Shannon, Simpson and Chao 1 indices. In addition to α-diversity, β-diversity, such as principal coordinates analysis (PCoA), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) coupled with effect size measurements (LEfSe), showed a differential profile after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, a total of 30 bacteria were significantly altered in the LPS + saline treated mice and LPS + ketamine treated mice. Interestingly, two bacteria, including the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were significantly correlated with the immobility time of FST. Importantly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves demonstrated that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia were potential biomarker for the antidepressant effects of ketamine in an inflammation model. These findings suggest that antidepressant effects of ketamine might be related to the regulation of abnormal composition of gut microbiota, and that the phylum Actinobacteria and the class Coriobacteriia might be potential biomarkers for ketamine's antidepressant efficacy."

In addition, health care costs are higher and health-related quality of life is lower in depressed patients with CAD. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed for the association of increased events seen in this population. Studies have focused on antidepressants (specifically, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mirtazapine), psychotherapy (cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy), and a wide range of other nonpharmacologic interventions. Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments are known to improve depressive symptoms in patients with CAD, but their effects on outcomes such as mortality and hospital admissions remain controversial. If treatment of depression is warranted, strategies should include sertraline or citalopram, with or without cognitive behavioral therapy, based on the known efficacy and safety of the drugs in this population. Nonpharmacologic therapy such as aerobic exercise has been shown to improve not only depression but also cardiovascular health. When selecting an appropriate antidepressant, clinicians should consider their patients' comorbid conditions and the potential for drug interactions, and treatment should be frequently monitored. Screening for depression in patients with cardiac disease should be instituted on a routine basis by using either case-finding or symptom-triggered approaches. Based on the high prevalence of depression and its known adverse effects in patients with CAD, future research is needed to help determine the role of antidepressants and nonpharmacologic strategies in improving outcomes in patients with both comorbidities."

In this chapter, we discuss the basic principles underlying the role of biomarkers in psychiatric pathology and then explore multiple biomarkers that are specific to depression. These include endophenotypes, gene variants/polymorphisms, epigenetic factors such as methylation, biochemical measures, circadian rhythm dysregulation, and neuroimaging findings. We also examine the role of early childhood trauma in the development of, and treatment response to, depression.

          "abstract": "Depression is a common psychiatric disease and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. In spite of certain developments in this field, chemical and synthetic drugs used for the treatment of depression disrupt the treatment process due to numerous side effects and high cost. Today, the goal of using a potential method for treating depression involves the use of medicinal and phytochemical plants, which have many therapeutic benefits. Studies have shown that medicinal plants affect the nervous system and exert antidepressant effects in various ways, including synaptic regulation of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, and inflammatory mediators. In this study, depression as well as the factors and mechanisms involved in its development are first addressed, and then medicinal plants effective in the treatment of depression along with their mechanisms of actions are reported."

          "abstract": "Inflammatory cytokines are commonly elevated in acute depression and are associated with resistance to monoaminergic treatment. To examine the potential role of cytokines in the pathogenesis and treatment of depression, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of antidepressant activity of anti-cytokine treatment using clinical trials of chronic inflammatory conditions where depressive symptoms were measured as a secondary outcome. Systematic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane databases, search of reference lists and conference abstracts, followed by study selection process yielded 20 clinical trials. Random effect meta-analysis of seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 2370 participants showed a significant antidepressant effect of anti-cytokine treatment compared with placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD)=0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.22-0.59). Anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs were most commonly studied (five RCTs); SMD=0.33 (95% CI; 0.06-0.60). Separate meta-analyses of two RCTs of adjunctive treatment with anti-cytokine therapy and eight non-randomised and/or non-placebo studies yielded similar small-to-medium effect estimates favouring anti-cytokine therapy; SMD=0.19 (95% CI, 0.00-0.37) and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.34-0.67), respectively. Adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab and tocilizumab all showed statistically significant improvements in depressive symptoms. Meta-regression exploring predictors of response found that the antidepressant effect was associated with baseline symptom severity (P=0.018) but not with improvement in primary physical illness, sex, age or study duration. The findings indicate a potentially causal role for cytokines in depression and that cytokine modulators may be novel drugs for depression in chronically inflamed subjects. The field now requires RCTs of cytokine modulators using depression as the primary outcome in subjects with high inflammation who are free of other physical illnesses."

Increasing preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted that compositional and functional (e.g., metabolite) changes in gut microbiota, known as dysbiosis, are associated with the onset and progression of depression via regulating the gut-brain axis. However, the gut microbiota and their metabolites present a double-edged sword in depression. Dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of depression while, at the same time, offering a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we describe the association between dysbiosis and depression, drug-microbiota interactions in antidepressant treatment, and the potential health benefits of microbial-targeted therapeutics in depression, including dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and postbiotics.

ECT gives the most reliable and most rapid results but may be contraindicated in certain cases. Psychotherapy is limited in its application to the reactive aspects of a depression. Pharmacotherapy is currently the most widely applied treatment of depression. Two classes of drugs are available which are effective in about 60% of depressed patients: the monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic compounds. Their mechanism of action is probably related to the regulation of the biogenic amine balance in the brain. The distinction between antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs is not as sharp as was formerly assumed. Maintenance pharmacotherapy has been shown to have prophylactic value in preventing relapses."

It has come to refer to the use of psychoactive substances to effect changes in function for conditions that are either normal or subclinical variants. In this paper, I ask: What distinguishes an existential ailment from clinical depression, or either of those from normal depressed mood, melancholic temperament, dysthymia or other depressive disorders? Can we reliably distinguish one from the other? Are the boundaries of illness and disorder really so distinct? If not, how can we know that treatment of 'depression' with Prozac in any given instance constitutes a cosmetic as opposed to, say, a medical or clinical use of psychopharmacology - a distinction that seems to turn on our ability to clearly differentiate the clinical from the cosmetic. If we cannot reliably distinguish between such conditions, can we even have a cosmetic psychopharmacology that is not a form of malpractice, broadly speaking? What if we unplugged Prozac from all the amplitude and hype that resulted in Listening to Prozac becoming an instant best-seller and simply asked whether or not we can clearly distinguish an appropriate cosmetic use of Prozac for 'depression' from an inappropriate cosmetic use of Prozac, and both of those from Prozac's appropriate clinical, that is, non-cosmetic uses? If we cannot make these distinctions, perhaps it is too early to say there can be such a thing as a cosmetic psychopharmacology."

          "abstract": "Microglia are involved in synaptic pruning both in development and in the mature CNS. In this study, we investigated whether microglia might further contribute to circuit plasticity by modulating neuronal recruitment from the neurogenic subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mouse striatum. We found that microglia residing in the SVZ and adjacent rostral migratory stream (RMS) comprise a morphologically and antigenically distinct phenotype of immune effectors. Whereas exhibiting characteristics of alternatively activated microglia, the SVZ/RMS microglia were clearly distinguished by their low expression of purinoceptors and lack of ATP-elicitable chemotaxis. Furthermore, the in vivo depletion of these microglia hampered the survival and migration of newly generated neuroblasts through the RMS to the olfactory bulb. SVZ and RMS microglia thus appear to comprise a functionally distinct class that is selectively adapted to the support and direction of neuronal integration into the olfactory circuitry. Therefore, this unique microglial subpopulation may serve as a novel target with which to modulate cellular addition from endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells of the adult brain. Microglial cells are a specialized population of macrophages in the CNS, playing key roles as immune mediators. As integral components in the CNS, the microglia stand out for using the same mechanisms, phagocytosis and cytochemokine release, to promote homeostasis, synaptic pruning, and neural circuitry sculpture. Here, we addressed microglial functions in the subventricular zone (SVZ), the major postnatal neurogenic niche. Our results depict microglia as a conspicuous component of SVZ and its anterior extension, the rostral migratory stream, a pathway used by neuroblasts during their transit toward olfactory bulb layers. In addition to other unique populations residing in the SVZ niche, microglia display distinct morphofunctional properties that boost neuronal progenitor survival and migration in the mammalian brain."

Activation of classical complement pathway promotes microglia-mediated synaptic pruning during development and disease. CD47 protects synapses from excessive pruning during development, implicating microglial SIRPα, a CD47 receptor, in synaptic remodeling. However, the role of microglial SIRPα in synaptic pruning in disease remains unclear. Here, using conditional knock-out mice, we show that microglia-specific deletion of SIRPα results in decreased synaptic density. In human tissue, we observe that microglial SIRPα expression declines alongside the progression of Alzheimer's disease. To investigate the role of SIRPα in neurodegeneration, we modulate the expression of microglial SIRPα in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Loss of microglial SIRPα results in increased synaptic loss mediated by microglia engulfment and enhanced cognitive impairment. Together, these results suggest that microglial SIRPα regulates synaptic pruning in neurodegeneration."

          "abstract": "During early development, neurons in the brain often form excess synaptic connections. Later, they strengthen some connections while eliminating others to build functional neuronal circuits. In the olfactory bulb, a mitral cell initially extends multiple dendrites to multiple glomeruli but eventually forms a single primary dendrite through the activity-dependent dendrite pruning process. Recent studies have reported that microglia facilitate synapse pruning during the circuit remodeling in some systems. It has remained unclear whether microglia are involved in the activity-dependent dendrite pruning in the developing brains. Here, we examined whether microglia are required for the developmental dendrite pruning of mitral cells in mice. To deplete microglia in the fetal brain, we treated mice with a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX5622, from pregnancy. Microglia were reduced by >90% in mice treated with PLX5622. However, dendrite pruning of mitral cells was not significantly affected. Moreover, we found no significant differences in the number, density, and size of excitatory synapses formed in mitral cell dendrites. We also found no evidence for the role of microglia in the activity-dependent dendrite remodeling of layer 4 (L4) neurons in the barrel cortex. In contrast, the density of excitatory synapses (dendritic spines) in granule cells in the olfactory bulb was significantly increased in mice treated with PLX5622 at postnatal day (P) 6, suggesting a role for the regulation of dendritic spines. Our results indicate that microglia do not play a critical role in activity-dependent dendrite pruning at the neurite level during early postnatal development in mice."

Microglia survey neuronal activity and selectively modify synaptic connections at the level of individual dendrites and synapses. This is important given that microglia are necessary for a healthy nervous system capable of learning and other neural phenomena based on synaptic modifications and can also cause pathological synaptic disfunctions in immunologically driven neurodegenerative diseases.

Mounting evidence indicates that the complement cascade of the innate immune system plays an important role in synapse elimination. Studies indicate that excess synapses during development are opsonized by complement proteins and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia which expresses complement receptors. The process is regulated by diverse molecular signals, including complement inhibitors that affect the activation of complement, as well as signals that affect microglial recruitment and activation. These signals may promote or inhibit the removal of specific sets of synapses during development. The complement-microglia system has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of several developmental brain disorders, suggesting that the dysregulation of mechanisms of synapse pruning may underlie the specific circuitry defects in these diseases. Here, we review the latest evidence on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of complement-dependent and microglia-dependent synapse elimination during brain development, and highlight the potential of this system as a therapeutic target for developmental brain disorders.

Fezolinetant is a novel oral non-hormonal drug recently approved for the treatment of moderate-severe VMS.

Fezolinetant has shown efficacy in reducing the frequency and severity of VMS with a positive impact on sleep- and health-related QoL and acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Given the limited availability of effective non-hormonal options for VMS, fezolinetant could potentially represent a game-changer for care of menopausal women, especially when relative or absolute contraindications to MHT use are present.

There is therefore a need for safe, effective non-hormonal therapy for relief of menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS).<b>Areas covered</b>: This narrative review summarizes the dataset accrued for fezolinetant, a neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) antagonist in clinical development for menopause-associated VMS.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Altered signaling in neuroendocrine circuits at menopause leads to VMS wherein NK3R activity plays a key role to modulate the thermoregulatory center in a manner conducive to triggering the 'hot flash' response. Thus, a new generation of NK3R antagonists has entered clinical development to specifically target the mechanistic basis of VMS. Fezolinetant is the most advanced NK3R antagonist in terms of stage of clinical development. Results to date have demonstrated rapid and substantial reduction in VMS frequency and severity and associated improvements in health-related quality of life.

SKYLIGHT 1 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week, phase 3 trial with a 40-week active treatment extension. This trial was done at 97 facilities across the USA, Canada, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Spain, and the UK. Women aged 40-65 years with an average of seven or more moderate-to-severe hot flashes per day were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to once-daily exact-matched placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg, or fezolinetant 45 mg. Randomisation was done using a web-based interactive response system and investigators, project team members, clinical staff, and participants were masked to treatment assignment. Coprimary endpoints were mean change in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms from baseline to weeks 4 and 12. The efficacy and safety analyses comprised all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04003155) and is completed. Between July 11, 2019, and Aug 11, 2021, 2205 women were recruited of whom 175 were assigned to placebo, 176 to fezolinetant 30 mg, and 176 to fezolinetant 45 mg (175 in the placebo group, 174 in the fezolinetant 30 mg group, and 173 in the fezolinetant 45 mg received at least one dose [safety analysis set]). One participant randomly assigned to fezolinetant 45 mg received fezolinetant 30 mg in error, so the efficacy analysis set (full analysis set) consisted of 173 in the fezolinetant 30 mg group and 174 in the fezolinetant 45 mg group. 23 participants in the placebo group, 31 in the fezolinetant 30 mg group, and 13 in the fezolinetant 45 mg group discontinued treatment before week 12, mostly due to adverse events or participant withdrawal. Compared with placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg and fezolinetant 45 mg significantly reduced the frequency of vasomotor symptoms at week 4 (difference in change in least squares mean -1·87 [SE 0·42; p<0·001], -2·07 [SE 0·42; p<0·001]) and week 12 (-2·39 [SE 0·44; p<0·001], -2·55 [SE 0·43; p<0·001]). Compared with placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg and 45 mg significantly reduced the severity of vasomotor symptoms at week 4 (-0·15 [0·06; p=0·012], -0·19 [0·06; p=0·002]) and week 12 (-0·24 [0·08; p=0·002], -0·20 [0·08; p=0·007]). Improvements in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms were observed after 1 week and maintained over 52 weeks. During the first 12 weeks, treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 65 (37%) of 174 women in the fezolinetant 30 mg group, 75 (43%) of 173 in the fezolinetant 45 mg group, and 78 (45%) of 175 in the placebo group. The incidence of liver enzyme elevations was low (placebo n=1; fezolinetant 30 mg n=2; fezolinetant 45 mg n=0) and these events were generally asymptomatic, transient, and resolved while on treatment or after treatment discontinuation. Data support the clinical use of fezolinetant as a non-hormonal treatment for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. The study was placebo-controlled for 12 weeks followed by a 40-week blinded extension to assess the maintenance of effect. Furthermore, the population studied was diverse and representative of the potential target population for fezolinetant therapy. Further characterisation of the benefit of fezolinetant on quality of life, including on symptoms of mood and sexual wellbeing, merits investigation. Astellas Pharma."

          "abstract": "Women going through menopause frequently experience vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, and sleep disturbances, significantly influencing their quality of life. Hormonal therapy has been demonstrated to be beneficial in treating VMS. However, due to specific restrictions, it is not recommended for every woman. Fezolinetant, a neurokinin 3 antagonist and non-hormonal treatment for severe to moderate VMS, functions by inhibiting neuronal impulses originating from the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. Current Skylight 2 and 4 trials statistically demonstrate the safety and acceptability of fezolinetant, with relatively few adverse effects reported. Fezolinetant has been shown great potential for treating menopausal-related VMS, supporting its further advancement. However, further investigation is required to thoroughly evaluate its safety, effectiveness, and its impact on sleep patterns."

          "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the efficacy of the neurokinin 3 receptor antagonist, fezolinetant, according to several intrinsic (individual related) and extrinsic (external influence) factors that may influence the frequency and severity of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) using pooled 12-week data from SKYLIGHT 1 and 2. SKYLIGHT 1 and 2 were two phase 3, randomized, double-blind studies conducted from July 2019 to August 2021 (SKYLIGHT 1) or April 2021 (SKYLIGHT 2). Participants were initially randomized to receive daily doses of placebo, fezolinetant 30 mg, or fezolinetant 45 mg. After 12 weeks, placebo participants were rerandomized to receive fezolinetant 30 mg or 45 mg, whereas those receiving fezolinetant continued on the same dose. Change in VMS frequency from baseline to week 12 was used to assess efficacy according to several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Overall efficacy and safety were also investigated. Overall, 1,022 individuals were included. Fezolinetant was efficacious in reducing VMS frequency across all intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Efficacy was most notable for participants who self-identify as Black (least squares mean difference for fezolinetant 45 mg versus placebo, -3.67; 95% CI, -5.32 to -2.01), current smokers (-3.48; -5.19 to -1.77), and current alcohol users (-3.48; -4.42 to -2.54). Overall efficacy was -2.51 (95% CI, -3.20 to -1.82) for fezolinetant 45 mg versus placebo. Similar findings were observed for the fezolinetant 30 mg dose. Comparable incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events were observed for placebo (132 of 342 individuals [38.6%]), fezolinetant 30 mg (132 of 340 individuals [38.8%]), and fezolinetant 45 mg (135 of 340 individuals [39.7%]). None of the intrinsic and extrinsic factors analyzed substantially reduced the efficacy response to fezolinetant in SKYLIGHT 1 and 2. These data provide additional confidence for using fezolinetant in a diverse population of individuals with VMS."

Concerning malformations in newborns whose mothers were treated with DES, clitoromegaly and malformations of the uterus were reported in females and genital lesions in males. However, the frequencies of major congenital anomalies were not greater than expected. We report three cases of limb reduction defects (LRD) in the first generation of children whose mothers were treated with DES during pregnancy, and two children (one male, one female) with deafness in the second generation after intrauterine exposure to DES. The LRD were not associated with other congenital anomalies. The malformed children with LRD were born between 1965 and 1973. The deafness was also isolated. The two mothers who have no hearing problems and who are healthy were exposed in utero to DES in 1963 and 1965, respectively. Their children were born in 1989 and 1994, respectively. In conclusion, the association of LRD and hearing loss with intrauterine exposure to DES could be coincidental. However, some hypothesis may explain these associations. Congenital hearing loss in the second generation may suggest a transgenerational effect."

          "abstract": "Diethylstilbestrol is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen that was used to prevent miscarriage and other pregnancy complications between 1938 and 1971 in the United States. In 1971, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about the use of diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy after a relationship between exposure to this synthetic estrogen and the development of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix was found in young women whose mothers had taken diethylstilbestrol while they were pregnant. Although diethylstilbestrol has not been given to pregnant women in the United States for more than 30 years, its effects continue to be seen. Women who took diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy have a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than the general population and therefore should be encouraged to have regular mammography. Women who were exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero may have structural reproductive tract anomalies, an increased infertility rate, and poor pregnancy outcomes. However, the majority of these women have been able to deliver successfully. Recommendations for gynecologic examinations include vaginal and cervical digital palpation, which may provide the only evidence of clear cell adenocarcinoma. Initial colposcopic examination should be considered; if the findings are abnormal, colposcopy should be repeated annually. If the initial colposcopic examination is normal, annual cervical and vaginal cytology is recommended. Because of the higher risk of spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and preterm delivery, obstetric consultation may be required for pregnant women who had in utero diethylstilbestrol exposure. The male offspring of women who took diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy have an increased incidence of genital abnormalities and a possibly increased risk of prostate and testicular cancer. Routine prostate cancer screening and testicular self-examination should be encouraged."

Based on structural similarities to other known estrogenic compounds and to the frequency of use among pregnant women, phenobarbital, saccharin and acetaminophen were assayed for estrogenic activity; DES was used as a positive control. Using a competitive receptor binding assay, these compounds did not show appreciable binding to a soluble uterine receptor preparation while DES showed strong binding interactions. Analysis of the compounds in an in vivo uterotropic bioassay using immature female mice showed that, over the dose range used (5 micrograms/kg-50 micrograms/kg), only DES had any estrogenic activity while the other compounds were negative. Therefore, phenobarbital, saccharin and acetaminophen did not display estrogenic activity under the conditions of test."

The consequences of in utero exposure to DES on female progeny have been widely publicized. However, male progeny also suffer the effects of in utero exposure to DES.

We explored the relationship of several biochemical parameters available at the pediatric emergency care setting with the need of advanced respiratory support (ARS): continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), biphasic positive airway pressure (BiPAP), or invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) in bronchiolitis. Single-center, prospective, observational, including infants aged less than 12 months diagnosed with acute bronchiolitis at the Pediatric Emergency Department. Determination of plasmatic values of several laboratory tests was performed at the time of hospital admission. Multivariate logistic analysis identified independent predictors for need of ARS. From October 1, 2018 to May 1, 2020, we recruited 149 infants (58% males; median age of 1 [0.5-2.5] month). Thirty-seven (25%) cases required ARS. After adjusting by age, bacterial superinfection, and comorbidities in the multivariate analysis, only higher levels of glycemia (p = 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.028), CRP/albumin ratio (p = 0.032), and NT-proBNP (p = 0.001) remained independently associated with ARS. These biomarkers reached moderate prediction accuracy with area under the curve of receiver operator curve curves ranging from 0.701 to 0.830 (p = 0.001). All they presented relatively high specificity (0.75-0.84) and negative predictive values (0.77-0.89) with low sensitivity and positive predictive values. They also correlated significantly with length of stay hospitalization (p = 0.001). Increased plasmatic levels of CRP, CRP/albumin ratio, glycemia, and NT-proBNP at hospital admission are associated with the need for ARS in infants with acute bronchiolitis."

Recent investigations have shown that the receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) and its soluble isoforms (sRAGE) play a critical role in the pathogenesis of lung injury. Main objective was to assess the serum levels of sRAGE of children with severe bronchiolitis admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Secondary objective was to study sRAGE correlation with the evolution and traditional biomarkers. Prospective, observational and descriptive study, 43 healthy controls and 37 patients (December 2011-February 2012) were enrolled. sRAGE levels were assessed and compared. In patients, the relation between sRAGE levels and clinical evolution, respiratory assistance, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophils count, serum C-reactive protein, and serum procalcitonin was analyzed. A statistical difference was found in the mean value of sRAGE at PICU admission between patients and controls (1,215.7 ± 535 vs 849 ± 579 pg/ml). Also a significant inverse correlation was found between sRAGE and the Wood-Downes Score at admission (p = 0.02). Serum sRAGE could be elevated in children with bronchiolitis. Larger clinical studies are necessary to elucidate its role as a bronchiolitis inflammatory and/or lung injury biomarker."

To assess the correlation between the clinical severity of acute bronchiolitis, serum KL-6, and the causative viruses, 222 infants with acute bronchiolitis presenting at the Pediatric Emergency Department of Estaing University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France, were prospectively enrolled from October 2011 to May 2012. Disease severity was assessed with a score calculated from oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and respiratory effort. A nasopharyngeal aspirate was collected to screen for a panel of 20 respiratory viruses. Serum was assessed and compared with a control group of 38 bronchiolitis-free infants. No significant difference in KL-6 levels was found between the children with bronchiolitis (mean 231 IU/mL ± 106) and those without (230 IU/mL ± 102), or between children who were hospitalized or not, or between the types of virus. No correlation was found between serum KL-6 levels and the disease severity score. The absence of Human Rhinovirus was a predictive factor for hospitalization (OR 3.4 [1.4-7.9]; P = 0.006). Older age and a higher oxygen saturation were protective factors (OR 0.65[0.55-0.77]; P < 0.0001 and OR 0.67 [0.54-0.85] P < 0.001, respectively). These results suggest that in infants presenting with bronchiolitis for the first time, clinical outcome depends more on the adaptive capacities of the host than on epithelial dysfunction intensity. Many of the features of bronchiolitis are affected by underlying disease and by treatment."

The aim of this study was to analyze the recovery of immune response after a bronchiolitis episode. Forty-nine infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis diagnosis were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) were processed. Twenty-seven pro-inflammatory biomarkers linked to innate immunity, inflammation, and epithelial damage, as well as nitrites and lipid mediators, were evaluated in the NPA supernatant by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and Luminex. Also, 11 genes were analyzed in NPA cells by quantitative PCR. A widespread statistically significant decline of multiple pro-inflammatory parameters and cytokines were detected in the recovery period after respiratory infection: interferon-α2 (IFNα2), IFNγ, interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-1β, IL-8, IFN-γ-inducible protein-10, vascular endothelial growth factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α), and MIP-1β.

A significant diminution of cysteinyl leukotriene C4 (LTC4) soluble levels (P = 0.0319) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression were observed in the recovery sample. In children classified by post-bronchiolitis wheezing, LTC4 remains elevated in the NPA supernatant. After bronchiolitis, cytokines and biomarkers linked to innate immune response in NPA decrease significantly in the recovery period accompanied by a drop in LTC4 levels; however, this reduction was lower in infants with post-bronchiolitis wheezing."

Follicular bronchiolitis has been associated with viral infection, autoimmune disease and immunodeficiency. The most common clinical manifestation is respiratory distress in infancy followed by a prolonged course with gradual improvement. We found no reports of systematic review of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings in pediatric follicular bronchiolitis. The purpose of this study was to describe the HRCT findings of follicular bronchiolitis in children and correlate these imaging findings with histopathology. A 5-year retrospective review of all pathology-proven cases of follicular bronchiolitis was performed. Inclusion criteria were age <18 years and an HRCT within 6 months of lung biopsy. HRCTs were reviewed by three observers and scored using the system previously described by Brody et al. Six patients met the inclusion criteria with age range at HRCT of 7-82 months (median: 39.5 months). Pulmonary nodules (n=6) were the most common HRCT finding followed by focal consolidation (n=5), bronchiectasis (n=4) and lymphadenopathy (n=3). Tree and bud opacities and nodules on CT correlated with interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates and discrete lymphoid follicles on pathology. The salient HRCT findings of childhood follicular bronchiolitis are bilateral, lower lung zone predominant pulmonary nodules and bronchiectasis with infantile onset of symptoms. These characteristic HRCT findings help differentiate follicular bronchiolitis from other forms of infantile onset ILD."

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans in children can be made with confidence based on clinical presentation, particularly with a history of adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, fixed obstructive lung disease on pulmonary function testing, and characteristic changes of mosaic perfusion, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis on chest high-resolution computed tomography, thus avoiding the need for lung biopsy in most patients. Patients with postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans generally have chronic, nonprogressive disease; in contrast, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans from Stevens-Johnson syndrome often have progressive disease that may require lung transplantation. Bronchiolitis obliterans is a rare form of chronic obstructive lung disease that follows a severe insult to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in fibrosis of the small airways. In the nontransplant pediatric population, adenovirus infection is the most common cause. Treatment is largely supportive and prognosis is mainly related to the underlying cause and to the severity of the initial insult."

          "abstract": "Acute bronchiolitis, usually caused by the respiratory syncytial virus, is the most common cause of severe respiratory distress in infants. The clinical relevance of cardiac biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of bronchiolitis in infants is still controversial. This Editorial discuss the results of a recent on the clinical relevance of cardiac specific biomarkers, NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) in 40 infants with bronchiolitis, 37% requiring admission in the ICU. NT-proBNP levels were significantly associated with prolonged hospitalization and duration of oxygen therapy, while cTnI levels, measured with high-sensitivity (hs) methods, did not. Furthermore NT-proBNP was significantly correlated with left and right ventricular functional echocardiographic parameters, while hs-cTnI was not associated with any echocardiographic parameter. Recent results confirm that NT-proBNP assay has a crucial role in the diagnosis, prognosis and follow-up of patients with cardiac disease not only in adult, but even in pediatric age). On the other hand, the clinical usefulness of assay of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT in pediatric cardiology, at present time, may be greatly limited by the lack of reliable reference intervals. Further well-designed multi-center studies are needed to more accurately evaluate the clinical relevance of cardio-specific biomarkers, and in particular of hs-cTnI and hs-cTnT assay, on prognosis of infants with bronchiolitis."

          "abstract": "The financial burden of bronchiolitis-related hospitalizations in the United States surpasses $700 million annually. Procalcitonin (PCT) has garnered recent interest in pediatrics and has demonstrated the potential to decrease antibiotic usage in other illnesses. This study assessed PCT utilization trends in bronchiolitis, hypothesizing an annual increase in PCT testing. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective cross-sectional study utilizing the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Infants aged 2 to 23 months presenting with bronchiolitis from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2022, were included. Encounters with and without PCT testing were compared using χ2 testing and Wilcoxon rank-sum testing as appropriate. Temporal trends in PCT testing and correlations with hospital-level proportions of PCT use, antibiotic administration, and admission proportion were assessed using Spearman's ρ. There were 366 643 bronchiolitis encounters among 307 949 distinct patients across 38 hospitals during the study period. Of those, 1.5% (5517 of 366 643) had PCT testing performed. PCT usage increased more than 14-fold between 2016 and 2022 (0.2% in 2016 vs 2.8% in 2022, ρ > 0.99, P < .001). PCT use ranged from 0.01% to 8.29% across hospitals. The hospital-level proportion of PCT testing was not associated with admissions (ρ = 0.13, P = .42) or antibiotic use (ρ = 0.31, P = .06). PCT testing in patients with bronchiolitis increased 14-fold between 2016 and 2022 and was not associated with decreased antimicrobial prescriptions. Further studies are needed to determine the diagnostic yield of PCT in bronchiolitis."

However, high rates of nonadherence have been documented. Our objective was to improve guideline adherence in infants with bronchiolitis. This quality improvement study was conducted in 1 urban academic pediatric primary care clinic caring for predominately minority and publicly insured children. We tested provider guideline education, display of guidelines in patient care areas, and monthly e-mails to all providers documenting deviation rates, with individual e-mails to providers who deviated. P-charts and interrupted time series analysis were used to estimate the effect of the intervention. There were 380 children <2 years of age with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis in the 16 nonsummer months preintervention and 417 in the 15 postintervention months. Rates of prescribed and administered albuterol declined from 45.7% in the baseline period to 13.7% in the intervention period and CR use dropped from a mean of 10.1% to 3.4%, both demonstrating special cause variation. Steroid use did not change significantly. In interrupted time series analyses, the intervention was associated with a significant decrease in albuterol use (<i>P</i> < .001) but not in CR or steroid use. Emergency department visits declined slightly but admissions for bronchiolitis were stable. Traditional quality improvement efforts coupled with social psychology techniques resulted in improved guideline adherence in outpatient bronchiolitis management. Additional study will help identify which techniques are most effective for increasing guideline adherence in cases of low-value care."

Despite advancements in immunotherapy, there remains a critical need to dissect each phase of the cycle, particularly the interactions among the tumor, vasculature, and immune system within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Innovative platforms such as organ-on-a-chip, organoids, and bioprinting within microphysiological systems (MPS) are increasingly utilized to enhance the understanding of these interactions. These systems meticulously replicate crucial aspects of the TME and immune responses, providing robust platforms to study cancer progression, immune evasion, and therapeutic interventions with greater physiological relevance. This review explores the latest advancements in MPS technologies for modeling various stages of the cancer-immune cycle, critically evaluating their applications and limitations in advancing the understanding of cancer-immune dynamics and guiding the development of next-generation immunotherapeutic strategies."

It emphasizes the iterative nature of the response where the killing of tumor cells by T cells initiates subsequent rounds of antigen presentation and T cell stimulation, maintaining active immunity and adapting it to tumor evolution. Any step of the cycle can become rate-limiting, rendering the immune system unable to control tumor growth. Here, we update the cancer-immunity cycle based on the remarkable progress of the past decade. Understanding the mechanism of checkpoint inhibition has evolved, as has our view of dendritic cells in sustaining anti-tumor immunity. We additionally account for the role of the tumor microenvironment in facilitating, not just suppressing, the anti-cancer response, and discuss the importance of considering a tumor's immunological phenotype, the \"immunotype\". While these new insights add some complexity to the cycle, they also provide new targets for research and therapeutic intervention."

Paclitaxel (PTX) is a classic chemotherapeutic agent, which could induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) to trigger the Cancer-Immunity Cycle. However, the Cycle is severely impaired by tumor cell immunosuppression of host T cell antitumor activity through the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (PD-1/PD-L1) immune checkpoint pathway. Here, we demonstrated that PTX mediated the Cancer-Immunity Cycle could be enhanced by PD-L1 knockdown (KD) and followed mTOR pathway inhibition in tumor cells. PD-L1 siRNA (siP) and the hydrophobic chemotherapy drug PTX were co-delivered with a rationally designed hybrid micelle (HM). We showed clear evidence that the HM-siP/PTX is capable of delivering siP and PTX simultaneously to the B16F10 cells both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that HM-PTX/siP reduced the expression of PD-L1 and p-S6K (a marker of mTOR pathway activation) both in vitro and in melanoma-bearing mice and attenuated synergistically tumor growth by chemical toxicity, promoting cytotoxic T-cell immunity and suppressing the mTOR pathway."

          "abstract": "The tumor-immune interplay represents a dynamic series of events executed by cellular and soluble participants that either promote or inhibit successful tumor formation and growth. Throughout a tumor's development and progression, the host organism's immune system reacts by generating anti-cancer defenses through various incremental and combinatorial mechanisms, and this reactive orchestration is termed the cancer-immunity cycle. Success or failure of the cancer-immunity cycle dictates the fate of both host and tumor as winner or loser. Insights into how the tumor and host immune system continuously adapt to each other throughout the lifecycle of the tumor is necessary to rationally develop new effective immunotherapies. Additionally, the evolving nature of the cancer-immunity cycle necessitates therapeutic agility, requiring real-time serial assessment of immunobiologic markers that permits tailoring of therapies to the everchanging tumor immune microenvironment. In order to accelerate advances in the field of immuno-oncology, this review summarizes the steps comprising the cancer-immunity cycle, and underscores key breakpoints in the cycle that either favor cancer regression or progression, as well as shaping of the tumor microenvironment and associated immune phenotypes. Furthermore, specific large animal models of spontaneous cancers that are deemed immunogenic will be reviewed and proposed as unique resources for validating investigational immunotherapeutic protocols that are informed by the cancer-immunity cycle. Collectively, this review will provide a progressive look into the dynamic interplay between tumor and host immune responses and raise awareness for how large animal models can be included for developing combinatorial and sequenced immunotherapies to maximizing favorable treatment outcomes."

Existing evidence indicates that the circadian clock functions as a gate that govern many aspects of the cancer-immunity cycle. In this review, we highlight the importance of the circadian clock during tumorigenesis, and discuss the potential role of the circadian clock in the cancer-immunity cycle.

It is assumed that only if each step of the cycle is activated and functioning properly, immune checkpoint inhibitors induce a meaningful immune response. However, an activated cancer-immunity cycle might not be present equally in each patient and cancer type. Ideally, treatment concepts should consider each single step of the cancer-immunity cycle and provide personalized treatment approaches, allowing the adaption to functioning and malfunctioning steps of the individual patient's specific cancer-immunity cycle.

In this research, we designed and tested a combined therapeutic-Au nanorod (AuNR)/doxorubicin (DOX) gel (AuNR/DOX gel)-in which the sustained release of DOX was controlled by Pluronic gel. DOX served as an immunogenic tumor cell death (ICD) inducer, triggering the production of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Mild photothermal therapy (Mild PTT) produced by 880 nm laser-irradiated AuNRs also generated tumor-associated antigens. Maleimide-modified liposomes (L-Mals), as antigen capturing agents, promoted tumor antigen uptake by DCs. Ultimately, more CD8+ T cells and fewer regulatory T cells (Tregs) infiltrated the tumor, eliciting antitumor responses from the PD-L1 antibody. Our results indicate that this combination strategy promotes a positive shift in the cancer-immunity cycle and holds much promise for combination strategy will lead to development of an antitumor drug delivery system. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Developing a combination therapy for cancer-immunity cycle is of great importance due to antitumor immune response involving a cascade of cancer-immunity cycles. Cancer-immunity cycle usually includes tumor antigen release, antigen presentation, immune activation, trafficking, infiltration, specific recognition of tumor cells by T cells, and finally cancer cell killing.

          "abstract": "Although immunotherapy harnessing activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T-cell-mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on efficiency of triggering the cancer-immunity cycle, namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer-immunity cycle. Due to high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting, and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle (EV)-based drug delivery systems are widely used to amplify anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer-immunity cycle. This review summarizes various mechanisms related to affecting cancer-immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, preparation and application of EV-based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer-immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, opportunities and challenges of EV-based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications are briefly discussed."

They also stimulate the synthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules. The existence of a chondrocyte cyto-protector effect and a potentially chondro-protective effect has also been demonstrated. ANOTHER MECHANISM OF ACTION: A new regulation route of chondrocyte metabolism has been proposed in which the Insulin Growth Factor (IGF-1) impedes the catabolic effects of another cytokine, Interleukin 1 (IL-1), by increasing its antagonistic receptor. This control appears essential in the maintenance extracellular matrix homeostasis. CARTILAGE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS: Chondrocytes from OA cartilage have the capacity to produce more constituting macromolecules of the extracellular matrix. Conversely, these same cells have a greater catabolic capacity. The enhanced activity of IL-1 and the concomitant decrease in its antagonistic receptors leads to the reduction in macromolecule levels in the extracellular matrix, produced in the Cell-associated matrix of OA chondrocytes.

This review summarises knowledge about the structure and signalling properties of the CGRP receptor. The clinical ramifications of targeting the CGRP receptor, the profiles of existing antagonists and the requirements for screening new compounds will be discussed. Readers will gain an overview of how current non-peptide antagonists seem to bind similar epitopes contributed by both calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1), the main CGRP receptor subunits. We will discuss how current antagonists have low bioavailability, limiting their use. For selectivity at CGRP receptors, it will be necessary to target parts of the receptor influenced by both RAMP1 and CLR. For the design of radically new antagonists, more structural information on the receptor is needed. Current screens are largely based on measuring CGRP-mediated changes in cAMP.

We propose that cellular responses to supra-pharmacological drug concentrations occur via distinctly different mechanisms and signaling pathways compared to the much lower plasma concentrations achieved with clinically relevant doses, and thus may not provide appropriate insights into a drug's mechanism of action."

MASLD in 43-44% of patients can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and 7-30% of these cases will progress to liver scarring (cirrhosis). To date, the mechanism of MASLD and its progression is not completely understood and there were no therapeutic strategies specifically tailored for MASLD/MASH until March 2024. The conventional antiobesity and antidiabetic pharmacological approaches used to reduce the progression of MASLD demonstrated favorable peripheral outcomes but insignificant effects on liver histology. Alternatively, phyto-synthesized metal-based nanoparticles (MNPs) are now being explored in the treatment of various liver diseases due to their unique bioactivities and reduced bystander effects. Although phytonanotherapy has not been explored in the clinical treatment of MASLD/MASH, MNPs such as gold NPs (AuNPs) and silver NPs (AgNPs) have been reported to improve metabolic processes by reducing blood glucose levels, body fat, and inflammation. Therefore, these actions suggest that MNPs can potentially be used in the treatment of MASLD/MASH and related metabolic diseases. Further studies are warranted to investigate the feasibility and efficacy of phytonanomedicine before clinical application."

There are some differences between MASLD and NAFLD, e.g., diagnostic criteria. MASLD is a hepatic steatosis without harmful alcohol consumption and is caused by metabolic factors. The prevalence of MASLD varies amongst different populations. The change in lifestyle plays a fundamental role in MASLD management, while there is no registered pharmacotherapy in this indication. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have been suggested to have a beneficial effect on hepatic steatosis, hence, they have been widely investigated as potential therapeutics in MASLD. In this review, we aimed to thoroughly summarize current evidence from original research about the effects of SGLT2i use on MASLD. Almost all discussed studies advocate using SGLT2i in MASLD because of their beneficial effects. It includes the loss of body weight, which is beneficial per se, and the improvement in hepatic parameters. Most importantly, steatosis reduction has been observed in patients using SGLT2i. We highly recommend further research in this field, which we believe will eventually lead to a new indication for SGLT2i, i.e., MASLD."

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a progressive form of MASLD characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the extrahepatic manifestations of MASH, focusing on chronic diseases related to the cardiovascular, muscular, and renal systems. A systematic review of published studies and literature was conducted to summarize the findings related to the systemic impacts of MASLD and MASH. The review focused on the association of MASLD and MASH with metabolic comorbidities, cardiovascular mortality, sarcopenia, and chronic kidney disease. Mechanistic insights into the concept of lipotoxic inflammatory \"spill over\" from the MASH-affected liver were also explored. MASLD and MASH are highly associated (50%-80%) with other metabolic comorbidities such as impaired insulin response, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. Furthermore, more than 90% of obese patients with type 2 diabetes have MASH. Data suggest that in middle-aged individuals (especially those aged 45-54), MASLD is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality, sarcopenia, and chronic kidney disease. The concept of lipotoxic inflammatory \"spill over\" from the MASH-affected liver plays a crucial role in mediating the systemic pathological effects observed. Understanding the multifaceted impact of MASH on the heart, muscle, and kidney is crucial for early detection and risk stratification. This knowledge is also timely for implementing comprehensive disease management strategies addressing multi-organ involvement in MASH pathogenesis."

From the multi-society Delphi consensus statement proposed a new term: metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in 2023. The term \"nonalcoholic\" was regarded as misleading on multiple grounds. Firstly, it failed to reflect the disease's metabolic origins. Secondly, it hindered patients' understanding. Thirdly, the terms \"nonalcoholic\" and \"fatty\" were regarded as stigmatising by patients and physicians in the field. The proposal of MASLD was a response to these concerns. Since its introduction, the Korean Association for the Study of the Liver has also introduced the new Korean term for MASLD, previously the NAFLD.

MASLD is estimated to affect more than one-third of adults worldwide. MASLD is closely associated with insulin resistance, obesity, gut microbial dysbiosis and genetic risk factors. The obesity epidemic and the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus greatly contribute to the increasing burden of MASLD. The treatment and prevention of major metabolic comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity will probably slow the growth of MASLD. In 2023, the field decided on a new nomenclature and agreed on a set of research and action priorities, and in 2024, the US FDA approved the first drug, resmetirom, for the treatment of non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced fibrosis. Reliable, validated biomarkers that can replace histology for patient selection and primary end points in MASH trials will greatly accelerate the drug development process. Additionally, noninvasive tests that can reliably determine treatment response or predict response to therapy are warranted. Sustained efforts are required to combat the burden of MASLD by tackling metabolic risk factors, improving risk stratification and linkage to care, and increasing access to therapeutic agents and non-pharmaceutical interventions."

MASLD is the most common cause of chronic liver disease and is the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. It is important that all stakeholders be involved in tackling the public health threat of obesity and obesity-related diseases, including MASLD. A simple and clear assessment and referral pathway using non-invasive tests is essential to ensure that patients with severe MASLD are identified and referred to specialist care, while patients with less severe disease remain in primary care, where they are best managed. While lifestyle intervention is the cornerstone of the management of patients with MASLD, cardiovascular disease risk must be properly assessed and managed because cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality. No pharmacological agent has been approved for the treatment of MASLD, but novel anti-hyperglycemic drugs appear to have benefit. Medications used for the treatment of diabetes and other metabolic conditions may need to be adjusted as liver disease progresses to cirrhosis, especially decompensated cirrhosis. Based on non-invasive tests, the concepts of compensated advanced chronic liver disease and clinically significant portal hypertension provide a practical approach to stratifying patients according to the risk of liver-related complications and can help manage such patients. Finally, prevention and management of sarcopenia should be considered in the management of patients with MASLD."

Diagnostic challenges arise, particularly in identifying MASLD in lean individuals, necessitating updated diagnostic protocols and investing in non-invasive diagnostic tools.

Additionally, understanding the roles of bile acid metabolism, the microbiome, and dietary interventions in MASLD pathogenesis and management holds promise for innovative therapeutic approaches.

To improve existing treatments a better understanding of the neurobiological and genetic basis of addictive behaviour and substance use disorder is warranted. The aim of this lecture is to develop a model of integrated translational addiction research which may result in the establishment of individualized therapeutic approaches for patients with substance use disorders. The genetic basis of substance use disorders is characterized by a contribution of multiple genes to the clinical phenotype. This genetic complexity is based on poly/oligogenicity and genetic heterogeneity, two parallel mechanisms which are present to varying extents in different substance use disorders. To disentangle the complexity and to identify the genetic and neurobiological basis of addictions an integrated, translational approach involving (functional) genetic analyses, animal behavioural experimentation and neuroimaging studies is proposed. Examples of this approach are provided by describing a line of work which identified the relevance of circadian rhythm genes in regulating alcohol drinking behaviour in animal models and humans, as well as a complementary approach using endophenotypes in human gene-neuroimaging studies where the effect of single and combined genetic variations on processing of aversive emotional stimuli in the limbic system was demonstrated. While the combination of genetic, behavioural and neuroimaging analyses are shown to be useful tools to address oligogenicity and genetic heterogeneity in substance use disorders, the clinical relevance of this approach needs to be developed further. Thus, two current major research projects, the European integrated project 'IMAGEN' and the NIHR-Biomedical Research Centre 'Mental Health' in the United Kingdom, which potentially integrate our proposed research strategy with clinically relevant outcomes, will be discussed."

Two main molecular genetic approaches, namely linkage and association, have been adopted to identify the specific genes involved. Both methods are fraught with problems. Linkage is limited by issues of sensitivity, and association by false positives. Perhaps the strongest finding in psychiatric genetics to date is the impressive effect that a single genetic variant, in the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 gene, has on drinking behaviour and reducing the risk of developing alcohol dependence. Other findings are currently less robust; however, the implications of elucidating the genetic underpinning of addiction will be profound.

          "abstract": "Addiction is a complex behavioral disorder arising from roughly equal contributions of genetic and environmental factors. Behavioral traits such as novelty-seeking, impulsivity, and cue-reactivity have been associated with vulnerability to addiction. These traits, at least in part, arise from individual variation in functional neural systems, such as increased striatal dopaminergic activity and decreased prefrontal cortical control over subcortical emotional and motivational responses. With a few exceptions, genetic studies have largely failed to consistently identify specific alleles that affect addiction liability. This may be due to the multifactorial nature of addiction, with different genes becoming more significant in certain environments or in certain subsets of the population. Epigenetic mechanisms may also be an important source of risk. Adolescence is a particularly critical time period in the development of addiction, and environmental factors at this stage of life can have a large influence on whether inherited risk factors are actually translated into addictive behaviors. Knowledge of how individual differences affect addiction liability at the level of genes, neural systems, behavioral traits, and sociodevelopmental trajectories can help to inform and improve clinical practice."

Advances in human genome sequencing and neuroimaging technology provide an unprecedented opportunity to explore the impact of functional genetic variants on variability in behaviorally relevant neural circuitry. Here, we present a model for merging these technologies to trace the links between genes, brain, and addictive behavior. We describe imaging genetics and discuss the utility of its application to addiction. We then review data pertaining to impulsivity and reward circuitry as an example of how genetic variation may lead to variation in behavioral phenotype. Finally, we present preliminary data relating the neural basis of reward processing to individual differences in nicotine dependence. Complex human behaviors such as addiction can be traced to their basic genetic building blocks by identifying intermediate behavioral phenotypes, associated neural circuitry, and underlying molecular signaling pathways. Impulsivity has been linked with variation in reward-related activation in the ventral striatum (VS), altered dopamine signaling, and functional polymorphisms of DRD2 and DAT1 genes. In smokers, changes in reward-related VS activation induced by smoking abstinence may be associated with severity of nicotine dependence. Variation in genes related to dopamine signaling may contribute to heterogeneity in VS sensitivity to reward and, ultimately, to addiction. These findings illustrate the utility of the imaging genetics approach for investigating the neurobiological basis for vulnerability to addiction."

Initially, efforts concentrated on enhancing T cell activity, leading to impressive results with immunotherapeutic approaches aimed at boosting T cell responses. Nevertheless, a substantial number of patients do not benefit from these treatments and continue to seek effective alternatives. In this context, NK cells present a promising avenue for developing new treatments, given their potent cytotoxic capabilities, safety profile, and activity against T cell-resistant tumors, such as those lacking HLA-I expression. Recent advancements in immunotherapy include strategies to restore and amplify NK cell activity through immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, adoptive NK cell therapy, and CAR-NK cell technology.

Nevertheless, current NK cell-based immunotherapies have several drawbacks, such as the requirement for ex vivo expansion of modified NK cells, and low transduction efficiency. Furthermore, to date, no clinical trial has demonstrated a significant benefit for NK-based therapies in patients with advanced solid tumors, mainly due to the suppressive TME. To overcome current obstacles in NK cell-based immunotherapies, we describe here a non-viral lipid nanoparticle-based delivery system that encapsulates small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to gene silence the key intrinsic inhibitory NK cell molecules, SHP-1, Cbl-b, and c-Cbl. The nanoparticles (NPs) target NK cells in vivo, silence inhibitory checkpoint signaling molecules, and unleash NK cell activity to eliminate tumors.

          "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a poor prognosis, and current treatments are limited by high toxicity and low survival rates, highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches. Natural killer (NK) cells can identify and eliminate cancer cells without prior antigen exposure. Radiotherapy directly targets tumors and increases activating ligands on tumor cells, promoting NK cell interactions. Cetuximab, an EGFR-targeting antibody, enhances NK cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, anti-PD-1 antibodies may further boost NK cell function by blocking inhibitory signals. The study aimed to enhance HNSCC treatment efficacy by combining radiotherapy and targeted therapy with expanded NK cells. NK cells were isolated, activated, and expanded from healthy donors. The FaDu and SCC-47 cell lines were inoculated into NOD/SCID mice. The mice were treated with PD-1 inhibitors, cetuximab, and radiation, followed by intravenous injection of NK cells. Radiation increased ligands that regulate NK cell sensitivity. The combination of cetuximab, radiotherapy, and expanded NK cells significantly suppressed cancer progression and improved survival rates. However, adding anti-PD-1 antibodies did not further enhance outcomes. This study suggests that a multimodal approach combining cetuximab, radiotherapy, and NK cells can significantly improve HNSCC therapy efficacy, offering a novel and promising treatment strategy."

          "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are large granular lymphocytes capable of killing tumour cells in a non-MHC restricted manner. NK cells do not express cell-surface CD3, or any known target recognition structure analogous to the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) heterodimers (alpha beta or gamma delta). Consistent with their lack of expression of a CD3-TCR complex, NK cells do not require prior sensitization or antigen presentation by accessory cells to specifically recognize their tumour targets. Although NK cells do not express CD3-TCR, they do express CD2, the target of an alternative activation pathway which is functional in both T cells and NK cells. In T cells, this alternative activation pathway utilizes some component of the CD3-TCR complex as a transducer molecule that is required for mitogenesis. The fact that NK cells are activated by this alternative pathway suggested that they might express a related subunit of the CD3-TCR complex capable of transducing the CD2-mediated signal. Here we show that human NK cells express the zeta-chain of the TCR complex in association with additional structures not included in CD3-TCR."

          "abstract": "Advanced pancreatic cancer patients have a dismal prognosis despite advances in integrative therapy. The field of tumor immunology has witnessed significant advancements for cancer treatment. However, immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer is not very effective due to its highly complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocytes that play an important role in the innate immune system. NK cells do not require antigen pre-sensitization, nor are they confined by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). NK cells have the potential to eliminate cancer cells through CAR-dependent and CAR-independent pathways, demonstrating reduced levels of systemic toxicity in the process. The availability of several potential sources of NK cells is an additional benefit that contributes to meeting the therapeutic criteria. Adding nanotechnology to enhance the functions of effector NK cells is also an appealing strategy. This article primarily discusses various approaches recently been utilized to enhance the NK functions for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In addition, new advances in boosting NK cell therapeutic efficacy by nanoparticle mediation are presented, with a focus on pancreatic cancer."

The unique capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to attack cancer cells without antigen specificity makes them an optimal immunotherapeutic tool for targeting tumors. Several approaches are currently being pursued to maximize the anti-tumor properties of NK cells in the clinic, including the development of NK cell expansion protocols for adoptive transfer, the establishment of a favorable microenvironment for NK cell activity, the redirection of NK cell activity against tumor cells, and the blockage of inhibitory mechanisms that constrain NK cell function.

Recent advances in understanding NK-cell biology have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation and maturation of NK cells, in addition to the control of their effector functions by investigating the receptors and ligands involved in the recognition of cancer cells by NK cells. Such clarification of NK-cell recognition of cancer cells also revealed the mechanism by which cancer cells potentially evade NK-cell-dependent immune surveillance. Furthermore, the recent clinical results of T-cell-targeted cancer immunotherapy have increased the expectations for new immunotherapies by targeting NK cells. However, the potential use of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy is not fully understood. In this review, we discuss the current evidence and future potential of pharmacological targeting of NK cells in cancer immunotherapy."

The course is challenging, with less-than-optimal survival outcomes, even with aggressive multiagent chemotherapy and consideration for stem cell transplantation. Novel therapies focused on targetable pathways are being investigated to improve outcomes while simultaneously decreasing toxicity. In our review, we aim to evaluate the utilization of blinatumomab in B-cell ALL and provide insight on how this guides our management. Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immunotherapy that neutralizes malignant cells by instigating CD3-positive T cells to target CD19-positive B cells. However, this therapy targets both malignant and non-malignant lymphocytes with potentially severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome or neurotoxicity. Evidence evaluating utilization in the relapsed or refractory setting has been most supported; however, newer trials have also indicated improved survival in the frontline treatment of B-cell ALL. As this therapy is relatively new, the treatment team may include members who are less experienced with the typical treatment course and drug mechanics. This review synthesized available data investigating the effectiveness of blinatumomab effectiveness and its adverse events in addition to providing guidance on safe administration methods utilizing a multidisciplinary healthcare team. When care is coordinated in these settings, serious side effects can be recognized early, allowing for necessary intervention leading to improved quality of life and overall survival. Future research will continue to evaluate blinatumomab in different lines of therapy and expand its way into community settings."

In the field of oncology, BDs are designed to simultaneously bind a tumour antigen on the one side and an antigen present on the surface of effector cells on the other. This review summarizes the information available to date on the first marketed BiTE-format bispecific antibody, blinatumomab BLINCYTO® in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. A literature search was conducted in the PubMed database by including studies published in English using the term blinatumomab. Furthermore, bibliographies of selected references were also evaluated for relevant articles. Clinical trial (CT) data were retrieved from clinicaltrials.gov (ongoing trials, adverse events [AEs]) and global pharmacovigilance data were retrieved from VigiBase®. Blinatumomab is a fusion protein which consists of two single-chain variable fragments arranged in tandem: the first binds the CD19 surface antigen of all B cells and the second targets the CD3 antigen of T cells. Binding of blinatumomab to B and T cells induces apoptosis of B cells after secretion of granzymes and perforins by T cells. T-cell activation results in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulation of activation markers and adhesion molecules on the surface of T cells. The major CTs that led to an indication show increased overall survival with blinatumomab with better efficacy in patients in haematological remission with minimal residual disease ≥10<sup>-3</sup> . The major AEs are cytokine release syndrome, neurotoxicity and hypogammaglobulinemia. The three most frequent system organ classes in CTs are haematological, gastrointestinal and general disorders. These results are also found in VigiBase® but neurological disorders and infections appear more frequently in real life. This review summarizes the current knowledge of blinatumomab in the literature. The subject of many CTs is to improve the route of administration and expand the indications for treatment."

Ideally, an anticancer drug target should be specific to cancer cells, in order to both increase efficacy and decrease toxicity of the compound. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a membrane protein with proto-oncogenic properties that is expressed in a number of endothelium-derived cancers and is a promising anticancer drug target. Adecatumumab is a monoclonal, fully human IgG1 antibody that targets EpCAM, development of which is at present reaching Phase III trials. From a review of literature, we here update the rationale for using EpCAM as an anticancer target for monoclonal antibodies, with a special focus on adecatumumab. The fully human nature of adecatumumab is also discussed to put the drug in perspective with other related anti-EpCAM monoclonal antibodies, such as edrecolomab and catumaxomab. Adecatumumab studies are recapitulated, in order to provide the reader with a comprehensive view of the development of this promising anticancer agent.

Antibody-based therapies, such as blinatumomab or inotuzumab ozogamycin (IO) have led to improved outcomes. The impact of prior immunotherapy on chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-Cell therapeutic efficacy and toxicity is unknown. We describe a case series of ALL patients with prior exposure to blinatumomab or IO, who were treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domain (NCT02772198). We then review the literature on CAR-T post antibody-based therapy with either antibodies. Five adult patients with B-ALL were included. Three had active disease, and two were in morphological complete remission (CR) with minimal residual disease (MRD+). Therapy before CAR-T included blinatumomab (3/5 [60 %]) and IO (3/5 [60 %]), with one patient receiving both. One patient experienced severe cytokine release syndrome and central nervous system toxicity and subsequently died. At 28 days following treatment, two patients achieved CR with MRD negativity, and two had an MRD + CR. Two patients received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. At a median of 10 months (range, 5-26, three out of the four patients are still in CR, and one relapsed. The literature review identified a deficiency on data on the influence of blinatumumab and IO on outcomes post CAR-T therapy. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy after treatment with blinatumomab and/or IO in patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL is feasible and results in promising response rates in this case series.

          "abstract": "In this article, we summarize results from a clinical study called LOTIS-2, in which researchers looked at patients with a type of blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBCL for short. Patients received the drug loncastuximab tesirine, or Lonca for short, which targets a marker on the surface of tumor cells called CD19.Patient information from the LOTIS-2 study, other studies of Lonca, and information from scientific publications was used to develop a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model, which can predict how Lonca works in the body. The goal was to use the QSP model to see if CD19 levels can predict tumor size changes after Lonca treatment and if Lonca can still work to treat DLBCL when CD19 levels are very low. The prior LOTIS-1 and LOTIS-2 trials demonstrated an acceptable safety profile for Lonca, and therefore the current study did not evaluate safety data. Researchers used immunohistochemistry, a common technique to evaluate CD19 expression. They found that there was no association between patients who responded to Lonca treatment and levels of CD19 on their tumor cells. Some patients with low or even undetectable levels of CD19 on their tumor cells had observable decreases in tumor size after Lonca treatment. While Lonca uses the CD19 target to find and destroy cancer cells, Lonca does not require a large amount of CD19 to kill tumor cells. These results mean that Lonca may be an effective treatment for patients with DLBCL, even if CD19 expression in tumors is undetectable by immunohistochemistry."

This review summarizes drug discovery efforts on kinases that have been identified as key players mediating inflammation and autoimmune disorders. In particular, we discuss recent developments on well-established targets such as mammalian target of rapamycin, JAK3, spleen tyrosine kinase, p38α and lymphocyte specific kinase but provide also a perspective on emerging targets. The reader will obtain an overview of drug discovery efforts on kinases in inflammation, recent clinical and preclinical data and developed inhibitor scaffolds. In addition, the reader will be updated on issues in target validation of current drug targets and the potential of selected novel kinase targets in this important disease area. Cellular signaling networks that regulate inflammatory response are still poorly understood making rational selection of targets challenging. Recent data suggest that kinase targets that are specific to the immune system and mediate signals immediately downstream of surface receptors are most efficacious in the clinic."

Therefore, this study aims to explore the causal relationship and to identify potential factors that mediate between these two diseases.

Two-sample Mendelian randomization (two-sample MR) was employed to explore the causal relationship between asthma and bronchiectasis, with an additional dataset used for validation. Heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses were utilized to verify the robustness of the results. Subsequently, mediation MR analyses were performed to identify potential mediating factors. Lastly, a retrospective observational study was conducted to validate the findings. Preliminary inverse-variance weighted (IVW) results indicated there was a causal effect of asthma on bronchiectasis (odds ratio [OR] = 1.228, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.077-1.400, P = 0.002). Repetition validation yielded a consistent result. Mediation MR analysis demonstrated that the presence of nasal polyps (OR = 1.063, 95% CI: 1.015-1.113, mediation ratio = 30.492%, P = 0.009), acute sinusitis (OR = 1.062, 95% CI: 1.009-1.118, mediation ratio = 30.157%, P = 0.018), chronic sinusitis (OR = 1.085, 95% CI: 1.024-1.150, mediation ratio = 40.677%, P = 0.005), and peripheral eosinophil counts (OR = 1.013, 95% CI: 1.000-1.026, mediation ratio = 6.514%, P = 0.042) served as significant mediators in the occurrence and development of bronchiectasis induced by asthma. Furthermore, a retrospective observational study observed that bronchiectasis patients with asthma had a higher prevalence of sinusitis (5.043% vs 2.971%, P < 0.001), nasal polyps (0.536% vs 0.152%, P < 0.001), and rhinitis (13.197% vs 1.860%, P < 0.001).

The MR analysis uncovered a notable genetic association between asthma and bronchiectasis, which was partially mediated by sinusitis, nasal polyps, and eosinophils. A subsequent retrospective study provided further evidence by demonstrating that bronchiectasis patients with asthma had a higher prevalence of sinusitis, nasal polyps, an elevated proportion of eosinophils, and higher eosinophil counts."

          "abstract": "Although a proven relationship exists between the blood eosinophil count (BEC) and the severity of both asthma and COPD, its relationship with bronchiectasis has not been well established. The objective of this study was to analyze the relationship between BEC and the number and severity of exacerbations, and patients' responses to inhaled corticosteroid (IC) treatment in bronchiectasis RESEARCH QUESTION: Does an association exist among BEC, the number of exacerbations and severity of bronchiectasis, and IC treatment? This was a multicenter (43 centers) prospective observational study derived from the Spanish Bronchiectasis Registry. Patients with proven bronchiectasis and a known BEC were included, whereas those with asthma or antieosinophilic treatments were excluded. Patients were divided into four groups according to the BEC at the time of inclusion in the study in a steady-state situation: (1) eosinopenic bronchiectasis (< 50 eosinophils/μL), (2) low number of eosinophils (51-100/μL), (3) normal number of eosinophils (101-300/μL), and (4) eosinophilic bronchiectasis (> 300 eosinophils/μL). Nine hundred twenty-eight patients finally were included: 123 patients (13.3%) with < 50 eosinophils/μL (eosinopenic group), 164 patients (17.7%) with 50-100 eosinophils/μL, 488 patients (52.6%) with 101-300 eosinophils/μL, and 153 patients (16.5%) with > 300 eosinophils/μL (eosinophilic group). BEC showed a significant U-shaped relationship with severity, exacerbations, lung function, microbiologic profile, and IC treatment (these being higher in the eosinopenic group compared with the eosinophilic group). IC treatment significantly decreased the number and severity of exacerbations only in the group of bronchiectasis patients with > 300 eosinophils/μL. A significant U-shaped relationship was found between BEC and severity and exacerbations in bronchiectasis that was more pronounced in the eosinopenic group. IC treatment decreased the number and severity of exacerbations only in the eosinophilic group."

          "abstract": "Studies that have investigated the epidemiological relationship between bronchiectasis and cancers are scarce. In this study, we investigated the incidence and risk of cancer in 53,755 patients newly hospitalized with bronchiectasis between 1998 and 2010 using data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The comparison cohort comprised 215,020 people from the general population without bronchiectasis. The follow-up period extended from the initial hospitalization date for bronchiectasis to the date of a cancer diagnosis, censoring, or 31 December 2011. We used Cox proportional hazard regression models to analyze the risks of cancer by including the variables of sex, age, and comorbidities. The overall cancer incidence was higher in patients with bronchiectasis than in the comparison cohort (17.0 vs. 12.2 per 1000 person-years). The bronchiectasis patients exhibited a 1.46-fold greater risk of cancer than did the comparison cohort after we adjusted for age, sex and comorbidities [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.41-1.52]. Although the cancer incidence increased with age in both cohorts, the younger patients with bronchiectasis exhibited the greatest risk of cancer compared with the comparison cohort. Patients with bronchiectasis had a considerably higher risk of lung cancer (aHR = 2.40, 95% CI = 2.22-2.60), oesophageal cancer (aHR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.61-2.64), and hematologic malignancy (aHR = 2.02, 95% CI = 1.72-2.37) than did the comparison cohort. This nationwide cohort study suggested the patients with bronchiectasis exhibited increased substantial risks of certain cancer compared with the general population."

          "abstract": "Bronchiectasis is a disorder of persistent lung inflammation and recurrent infection, defined by a common pathological end point: irreversible bronchial dilatation arrived at through diverse etiologies. This suggests an interplay between immunogenetic susceptibility, immune dysregulation, bacterial infection, and lung damage. The damaged epithelium impairs mucus removal and facilitates bacterial infection with increased cough, sputum production, and airflow obstruction. Lung infection is caused by respiratory bacterial and fungal pathogens, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Aspergillus fumigatus, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. Recent studies have highlighted the relationship between the lung microbiota and microbial-pathogen niches. Disease may result from environments favoring interleukin-17-driven neutrophilia. Bronchiectasis may present in autoimmune disease, as well as conditions of immune dysregulation, such as combined variable immune deficiency, transporter associated with antigen processing-deficiency syndrome, and hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome. Differences in prevalence across geography and ethnicity implicate an etiological mix of genetics and environment underpinning susceptibility."

Despite being a major contributor to chronic lung disease, there are no licensed therapies for bronchiectasis and there remain relatively few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in children and adults. Our RCT will address some of these unmet needs by evaluating whether the novel mucoactive agent, erdosteine, has a therapeutic role in children and adults with bronchiectasis.Our primary aim is to determine in children and adults aged 2-49 years with bronchiectasis whether regular erdosteine over a 12-month period reduces acute respiratory exacerbations compared with placebo. Our primary hypothesis is that people with bronchiectasis who regularly use erdosteine will have fewer exacerbations than those receiving placebo.Our secondary aims are to determine the effect of the trial medications on quality of life (QoL) and other clinical outcomes (exacerbation duration, time-to-next exacerbation, hospitalisations, lung function, adverse events). We will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. We are undertaking an international multicentre, double-blind, placebo-RCT to evaluate whether 12 months of erdosteine is beneficial for children and adults with bronchiectasis. We will recruit 194 children and adults with bronchiectasis to a parallel, superiority RCT at eight sites across Australia, Malaysia and Philippines. Our primary endpoint is the rate of exacerbations over 12 months. Our main secondary outcomes are QoL, exacerbation duration, time-to-next exacerbation, hospitalisations and lung function. The Human Research Ethics Committees (HREC) of Children's Health Queensland (for all Australian sites), University of Malaya Medical Centre (Malaysia) and St. Luke's Medical Centre (Philippines) approved the study. We will publish the results and share the outcomes with the academic and medical community, funding and relevant patient organisations. ACTRN12621000315819."

We aimed to synthesize published randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on the efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists in T2DM, pre-diabetes, and obesity in children aged <18 years. Inclusion criteria were RCTs of any GLP-1 agonist, solely or in conjunction with other drugs, for the treatment of obesity, pre-diabetes, and/or T2DM in children aged <18 years old. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria (two for T2DM, one for pre-diabetes, and six for obesity without diabetes). In total, 286 children were allocated to GLP-1 agonist therapy. Compared with controls, GLP-1 agonist therapy reduced HbA1c by -0.30% (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.57, -0.04) with a larger effect in children with (pre-)diabetes (-0.72%; 95% CI -1.17, -0.28; three studies) than in children with obesity (-0.08%; 95% CI -0.13, -0.02; four studies). Conversely, GLP-1 agonist therapy reduced body weight more in children with obesity (-2.74 kg; 95% CI -3.77, -1.70; six studies) than in children with T2DM (-0.97 kg; 95% CI -2.01, 0.08; two studies). Adverse effects included gastrointestinal symptoms and minor hypoglycemic episodes, but not severe hypoglycemia. GLP-1 agonists are efficacious in treating children with obesity and/or T2DM. Effect sizes are comparable with those reported in adults."

          "abstract": "Obesity treatment based on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) proved to limit morbidity and mortality in adult population. In children, optimizing lifestyle intervention (LSI) and reducing culpable environmental exposures represent the mainstay strategy for obesity prevention and management. However, there remains a subset of children and adolescents whose obesity is resistant to lifestyle approach. For these poor responders, the need for safe and effective weight-reducing agents is apparent. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of approved GLP-1 RA in the management of adult and pediatric obesity. We presented the main outcomes of clinical trial programs called SCALE and STEP that supported a market authorization approval for liraglutide and semaglutide for the treatment of obesity in adult population. Then, we summarized the studies on the efficacy of GLP-1 RA in pediatric obesity that have been accumulating from 2 larger studies with liraglutide and few other smaller studies with exenatide and liraglutide. The results indicate that GLP-1 RA is safe, tolerable, and effective in reducing weight and also in improving cardiometabolic profile in children with obesity and poor response to LSI alone. At present, liraglutide is the first and so far the only GLP-1 RA that received FDA approval in 2020 for use in children aged 12-17 years with obesity. New trials including semaglutide for pediatric obesity are ongoing. There is a strong interest in current use and further development of obesity treatments based on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonism. In adolescents with obesity, who are poor responders to lifestyle approach, the use of GLP-1 RA as an adjunct to LSI is effective and safe. Due to limited experience, a general recommendation is to prioritize long acting over short acting GLP-1 RA because they are approved for the treatment of obesity and have better tolerability, safety, and treatment response effect. In the future research, more high-grade evidence including novel iterations of GLP-1 agonism and long-term follow-ups are needed in pediatric population."

          "abstract": "Effective treatments for pediatric obesity are limited. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists have emerged as therapeutic agents for obesity in adults and have shown benefits outside of weight loss. Here we explore the evidence for GLP-1R agonist use in pediatric obesity. Emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1R agonists have a role in pediatric obesity treatment. A recently published, randomized, placebo-controlled trial found a greater reduction in BMI z-score (- 0.22 SDs) in adolescents receiving liraglutide compared with placebo. As in adults, gastrointestinal adverse effects were commonly seen. GLP-1R agonists appear to perform favorably compared with other approved pharmacological agents for pediatric obesity. However, heterogeneity in weight loss response, cost, side effects, and need for injections may limit their use in many pediatric patients. Rather than broadly applying this therapy if it is approved, we suggest careful patient selection and monitoring by clinicians pending further studies."

On 19 September 2024, three scientists were presented with a Lasker Award for their basic clinical research on identifying and studying the roles of GLP-1. The research by Joel Habener, Svetlana Mojsov, and Lotte Bjerre Knudsen began three decades ago and has led to new anti-obesity drugs, which mimic GLP-1 to lower blood glucose levels and control appetite. The efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the management of obesity in adults, as well as in children and adolescents, has now been supported by several clinical trials.

GLP-1 receptor agonists have mechanisms independent of the hypothalamus which may be potentially beneficial for managing hypothalamic obesity. This systematic review summarizes the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists use in hypothalamic obesity. A PRISMA-compliant systematic review was performed. Data was extracted from included studies and analysed based on change in weight, body mass index, glycaemic control, satiety, and safety profile with GLP-1 receptor agonist use. Ten studies comprising 5 case reports, 4 case series and 1 randomized-controlled trial included 54 patients (24 males, 30 females) with mean age of 25.2 (range 13-71) years with hypothalamic obesity who had received GLP-1 receptor agonists (exenatide = 48, liraglutide = 5 and dulaglutide = 1) over a mean duration of treatment of 12 (range 3-51) months. Mean weight reduction of 7.4 (SD 7.92) kg was observed in patients in whom weight was reported, with 85.7% of patients experiencing weight loss. All patients on liraglutide had weight reduction post-therapy. The sole trial had reported a non-significant reduction in BMI post-exenatide. Glycaemic control had either improved/maintained in all patients in whom this was measured. The main side effects of GLP-1 receptor agonist in individuals with hypothalamic obesity were nausea and vomiting; there were no major safety concerns. Based on limited published experience, GLP-1RA may be effective and safe for weight control in hypothalamic obesity, with the added benefit of improved glycaemic control in those with concurrent diabetes mellitus."

          "abstract": "Pediatric obesity is a growing epidemic. Lifestyle modifications remain central to obesity treatment, however pharmacologic options have gained traction, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). This review aims to summarize evidence on the use of GLP-1RAs in the management of pediatric obesity, physiological mechanisms of action of GLP-1RAs and their role in appetite regulation and glucose homeostasis and address the challenges and special considerations surrounding GLP-1RA use. Recent studies have highlighted the efficacy of GLP-1RAs, such as exenatide, liraglutide, and semaglutide, in promoting weight loss and improving metabolic parameters in children and adolescents. GLP-1RA's efficacy extends beyond glycemic control to include weight loss mechanisms such as delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis), and appetite suppression. Semaglutide, the newest GLP-1RA, holds potential for substantial weight loss in adolescents and demonstrates a similar safety and efficacy as seen in adults. GLP-1RAs may offer a promising adjunct therapy for pediatric obesity, particularly in cases where lifestyle interventions alone are insufficient. However, further research is needed to elucidate long-term safety and efficacy outcomes and to address potential disparities in access to care. Overall, this review highlights the relevance and timeliness of incorporating GLP-1RAs into the comprehensive management of pediatric obesity."

The optimal use of these drugs in pediatric bariatric populations, and especially in those considering metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), is yet to be established. We sought to characterize current practice patterns of GLP-1A use at major pediatric bariatric centers across the United States. We administered an online survey to a purposive sample of 46 surgeons who perform MBS on children and adolescents. Survey questions explored practices prescribing GLP-1As in patients considering MBS, holding them prior to elective operations, and restarting them postoperatively following MBS. Responses were summarized with descriptive statistics and inductive content analysis. There were 22 responses (48% response rate) representing 19 institutions. Most (86%) respondents do sometimes prescribe GLP-1As for patients considering MBS, but the specific indications vary. Practices for holding GLP-1As preoperatively also vary, from not at all to holding for 2 wk. Over half (55%) of respondents sometimes restart GLP-1As after MBS. Free-response themes included still-evolving preoperative utilization patterns, difficulty with access and insurance coverage, and a lack of data informing GLP-1A use in the pre and postoperative periods. Given the increasing use of these medications for weight loss purposes, this substantial variation in practice highlights a need for further research to examine the safest and most effective use of GLP-1As in the pre and postoperative periods and for practice guidelines to standardize care pathways in pediatric bariatric contexts."

We searched the PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the EMBASE database for articles published until September 15, 2023, and limited to randomized control trials. The primary outcomes were changed from baseline in weight metrics and the cardiometabolic profile. A random effects model will be used, as high heterogeneity is expected. All analyses were performed using STATA 17.0. Fifteen trials with a total number of 1286 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Overall, the mean difference in weight change between the IBTs group and the control group was -2.89 kg (95% confidence interval, -5.12 to -0.65, p = 0.011). Additionally, IBTs significantly reduced the HbA<sub>1c</sub> level and fasting plasma glucose by 0.37% and 6.99 mg/dl, compared with control groups. IBTs showed a little increased risk of GI side effects and hypoglycemia events, but none of the severe hypoglycemia events were occurred in IBTs group. Our study results have proved that GLP-1 RAs are safe, acceptable, and effective in weight reduction and sugar control for children with obesity. In addition, DPP-4is seems to have no effect on glycemic control and weight loss in childhood obesity. Further research is needed to confirm these findings, especially in younger children."

We surveyed the members of the Pediatric Endocrine Society regarding the use of GLP-1RA in their practice. The respondents (n = 102) were predominantly from academic centers (84%) and 75%reported using GLP-1RA in pediatric patients, mostly to treat T2D and obesity. Patient tolerance for the medication was reported to be the driving factor determining the duration of treatment. Gastrointestinal side effects were observed more commonly than local reactions or elevation of pancreatic enzymes. Lack of clinical experience was reported to be a major barrier for prescribing GLP-1RA, particularly among those with more than 5 years of clinical experience. Finally, liraglutide was used more often (93%) than other GLP-1RA. The use of GLP-1RA has increased in pediatric patients. Recent Food and Drug Administration approval of liraglutide for pediatric obesity will likely further increase its prescription rate. Providers should be vigilant about side effects and adjust the doses of GLP-1RA accordingly. More efforts should be made by professional societies to educate pediatric endocrinology providers about the proper use of GLP-1RA and enhance their confidence in prescribing these medications."

Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) can contain biological information that could be correlated with overall survival (OS). We propose a simple extraction method and radiomic feature analysis based on IOUS imaging to estimate OS in GBM patients. A retrospective study of surgically treated glioblastomas between March 2018 and November 2019 was performed. Patients with IOUS B-mode and strain elastography were included. After preprocessing, segmentation and extraction of radiomic features were performed with LIFEx software. An evaluation of semantic segmentation was carried out using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). Using univariate correlations, radiomic features associated with OS were selected. Subsequently, survival analysis was conducted using Cox univariate regression and Kaplan-Meier curves. Sixteen patients were available for analysis. The DSC revealed excellent agreement for the segmentation of the tumour region. Of the 52 radiomic features, two texture features from B-mode (conventional mean and the grey-level zone length matrix/short-zone low grey-level emphasis [GLZLM_SZLGE]) and one texture feature from strain elastography (grey-level zone length matrix/long-zone high grey-level emphasis [GLZLM_LZHGE]) were significantly associated with OS. After establishing a cut-off point of the statistically significant radiomic features, we allocated patients in high- and low-risk groups. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed significant differences in OS. IOUS-based quantitative texture analysis in glioblastomas is feasible. Radiomic tumour region characteristics in B-mode and elastography appear to be significantly associated with OS."

The RSF radiomics models were successfully validated on the test set (iAUC, 0.652 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.524, 0.769] and 0.590 [95% CI: 0.502, 0.689] for OS and PFS, respectively). The addition of a radiomics model to clinical and genetic profiles improved survival prediction when compared with models containing clinical and genetic profiles alone (P = .04 and .03 for OS and PFS, respectively). Conclusion Radiomic MRI phenotyping can improve survival prediction when integrated with clinical and genetic profiles and thus has potential as a practical imaging biomarker. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

          "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Extracting multiregional radiomic features from multiparametric MRI for predicting pretreatment survival in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma (GBM) patients is a promising approach. <b>Methods:</b> MRI data from 49 IDH wild-type glioblastoma patients pre-treatment were utilized. Diffusion and perfusion maps were generated, and tumor subregions segmented. Radiomic features were extracted for each tissue type and map. Feature selection on 1862 radiomic features identified 25 significant features. The Cox proportional-hazards model with LASSO regularization was used to perform survival analysis. Internal and external validation used a 38-patient training cohort and an 11-patient validation cohort. Statistical significance was set at <i>p</i> < 0.05. <b>Results:</b> Age and six radiomic features (shape and first and second order) from T1W, diffusion, and perfusion maps contributed to the final model. Findings suggest that a small necrotic subregion, inhomogeneous vascularization in the solid non-enhancing subregion, and edema-related tissue damage in the enhancing and edema subregions are linked to poor survival. The model's C-Index was 0.66 (95% C.I. 0.54-0.80). External validation demonstrated good accuracy (AUC > 0.65) at all time points. <b>Conclusions:</b> Radiomics analysis, utilizing segmented perfusion and diffusion maps, provide predictive indicators of survival in IDH wild-type glioblastoma patients, revealing associations with microstructural and vascular heterogeneity in the tumor."

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a very aggressive and infiltrative brain tumor with a high mortality rate. There are radiomic models with handcrafted features to estimate glioblastoma prognosis. In this work, we evaluate to what extent of combining genomic with radiomic features makes an impact on the prognosis of overall survival (OS) in patients with GBM. We apply a hypercolumn-based convolutional network to segment tumor regions from magnetic resonance images (MRI), extract radiomic features (geometric, shape, histogram), and fuse with gene expression profiling data to predict survival rate for each patient. Several state-of-the-art regression models such as linear regression, support vector machine, and neural network are exploited to conduct prognosis analysis. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset of MRI and gene expression profiling is used in the study to observe the model performance in radiomic, genomic, and radiogenomic features. The results demonstrate that genomic data are correlated with the GBM OS prediction, and the radiogenomic model outperforms both radiomic and genomic models. We further illustrate the most significant genes, such as IL1B, KLHL4, ATP1A2, IQGAP2, and TMSL8, which contribute highly to prognosis analysis.

          "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether quantitative radiomic profiles extracted from multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) profiles can predict the clinical outcomes for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) before therapy. MR images from 93 treatment-naive patients with newly diagnosed GBM were analyzed. Through tumor segmentation, we selected 36 radiomic features. Using the unsupervised clustering method, we classified our patients into 2 groups and investigated their overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier analyses. Among the 36 radiomic features, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram parameters demonstrated a significant association with OS (P < 0.05). To validate this finding, unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 3 clusters with similar radiomic expression patterns. Clusters 1 and 2 showed a significant correlation with the radiomic features representing the tumor volume, and cluster 2 also showed a significant correlation with relative cerebral blood volume values. In contrast, cluster 3 showed an inverse relationship with cluster 2, mainly representing the radiomic features indicating the ADC and mean transit time. Although no statistically significant difference was found in OS between cluster 1 plus 2 and cluster 3, cluster 3 showed a trend toward longer OS compared with cluster 1 plus 2 (P = 0.067). After stratification by methylation status and radiomic feature clustering, patients with methylated O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and those included in cluster 3 had significantly longer OS (P = 0.029). ADC histogram parameters are feasible prognostic biomarkers to predict the survival of patients with treatment-naive GBM. Quantitative MR profiles can predict the clinical outcomes of patients with GBM before therapy."

The objective was to combine radiomic, semantic and clinical features to improve prediction of overall survival (OS) and O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status from pre-operative MRI in patients with glioblastoma. A retrospective study of 181 MRI studies (mean age 58 ± 13 years, mean OS 497 ± 354 days) performed in patients with histopathology-proven glioblastoma. Tumour mass, contrast-enhancement and necrosis were segmented from volumetric contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI). 333 radiomic features were extracted and 16 Visually Accessible Rembrandt Images (VASARI) features were evaluated by two experienced neuroradiologists. Top radiomic, VASARI and clinical features were used to build machine learning models to predict MGMT status, and all features including MGMT status were used to build Cox proportional hazards regression (Cox) and random survival forest (RSF) models for OS prediction. The optimal cut-off value for MGMT promoter methylation index was 12.75%; 42 radiomic features exhibited significant differences between high and low-methylation groups. However, model performance accuracy combining radiomic, VASARI and clinical features for MGMT status prediction varied between 45 and 67%. For OS predication, the RSF model based on clinical, VASARI and CE radiomic features achieved the best performance with an average iAUC of 96.2 ± 1.7 and C-index of 90.0 ± 0.3. VASARI features in combination with clinical and radiomic features from the enhancing tumour show promise for predicting OS with a high accuracy in patients with glioblastoma from pre-operative volumetric CE-T1WI."

Radiomics features were extracted from segmented lesions of T2-FLAIR MRI data of 137 GBM patients. Radiomics features include intensity, shape and textural features in seven classes were included in the analysis. Patients were divided into two groups depending on their survival time (shorter or longer than 1-year survival). Four different machine learning algorithms were implemented to construct the prediction models. Features with top importance (importance >0.04) were selected to construct the prediction model using the model with the best performance. The interactions between image features and genomics were then analysed with Pearson's correlation analysis. The GBDT model with 72 features with highest importance had the highest accuracy of 0.81 on both short and long survival time classes, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operative characteristic (ROC) of the short and long survival time class were 0.79 and 0.81. Six metagenes showed significant interactive effect (P < 0.05), and Pearson's correlation analysis revealed that three of these metagenes (TIMP1, ROS1 EREG) showed moderate (0.3 < |r| < 0.5) or high correlation (|r| > 0.5) with image features. Radiogenomics analysis shows that MRI features are predictive of survival outcomes, and image features are highly associated with selective metagenes.

Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 83 consecutive patients with glioblastoma were retrospectively reviewed and grouped into training (n = 59) and test sets (n = 24). A total of 6472 radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images and from fractional anisotropy (FA) and normalized cerebral blood volume (CBV) maps. A diagnostic model to predict 6-month progression was tested using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and compared with the single parameters of FA and CBV. A survival model was tested using Harrell's C-index and compared with clinical models that included age, sex, Karnofsky performance score, and extent of surgical resection. Four FA features and six CBV features were selected for the diagnostic model; no features were extracted from conventional MRI. Combined FA and CBV radiomics showed better predictive value for local progression (AUC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90) than single imaging radiomics (AUC, 0.70-0.76) or single imaging parameters (AUC, 0.51-0.54).

The efficacy of N-acetylcysteine in non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure is limited to specific patient populations.

          "abstract": "Paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose (POD) is the commonest cause of acute liver failure in Europe and North America. Current treatment involves the use of the antidote N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in patients deemed at risk of liver damage. This regimen was introduced in the 1970s and has remained largely unchanged even though the initial NAC infusion is frequently associated with adverse reactions, in particular nausea, vomiting, and anaphylactoid reactions. NAC has reduced efficacy for preventing liver injury in those patients who present later after overdose. We designed a randomised study investigating the safety and tolerability of a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, calmangafodipir (PP100-01), co-treatment with a 12-h NAC regimen compared with NAC treatment alone in patients with POD. We have designed an open-label, randomised, exploratory, rising dose design, NAC-controlled, phase 1 safety and tolerability study in patients treated with NAC for POD. A total of 24 patients will be assigned into one of three dosing cohorts of eight patients (n = 6 for PP100-01 and NAC; n = 2 for NAC alone). The doses of PP100-01 are 2, 5, and 10 μmol/kg. The primary outcome is the safety and tolerability of PP100-01 when co-administered with a 12-h NAC regimen compared with NAC treatment alone. Furthermore, the study will explore if PP100-01 has potential efficacy for the treatment of paracetamol-induced liver injury by measurement of conventional clinical and exploratory biomarkers. The aim of the study is to test the safety and tolerability of a SOD mimetic, PP100-01, in combination with a 12-h NAC regimen in patients presenting within 24 h of POD. This study will provide valuable data regarding the incidence of adverse events caused by the 12-h NAC plus PP100-01 regimen and may provide evidence of PP100-01 efficacy in the treatment of paracetamol-induced liver injury.

How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar.

A randomized case control study was conducted with the aim to determine the effect of NAC on the mortality of NAI-ALF patients, as well as to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NAC use. A total of 80 patients diagnosed with NAI-ALF were included in the study. Forty patients received NAC infusion for 72 h whereas the control group received placebo. The variables evaluated were demographic characteristics, signs and symptoms, biochemical parameters, and clinical course during hospitalization. The two groups (NAC and control) were comparable for various baseline characteristics (such as etiology of ALF, INR, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, albumin, and grade of encephalopathy), except for age. Although majority of patients had undetermined etiology (32.5% in NAC group and 42.5% in control group), the second main cause was acute hepatitis E and drug or toxin-induced ALF. The mortality decreased to 28% with the use of NAC versus 53% in the control group (P = 0.023). The use of NAC was associated with shorter length of hospital stay in survived patients (P = 0.002). Moreover, the survival of patients was improved by NAC (P = 0.025). Also, drug-induced ALF showed improved outcome compared to other etiologies. The findings of the study recommend the use of NAC along with conventional treatments in patients with NAI-ALF in non-transplant centers while awaiting referrals and conclude the use of NAC as safe."

Despite many years of intense research, the precise mechanisms of paracetamol-induced liver injury in humans are still not defined, and few studies have examined the optimal dosing regimen for clinical NAC use. It has been widely acknowledged that circulating biomarkers such as microRNA-122, keratin-18 and high mobility group box-1 hold potential to inform on the mechanistic-basis of human drug-induced liver injury. Here, we provide a perspective on the application of these mechanistic biomarkers to the deeper understanding of paracetamol hepatotoxicity in clinical and preclinical studies.

Currently, praziquantel (PZQ) represents the best pharmacological option for the treatment of schistosomiasis as it effectively kills the worm. However, the inability to reverse established liver damages often makes treatment futile. In the current study, we investigate whether combining the use of wogonin, a compound that was found to be liver-protective, with PZQ can attribute to the greatest beneficial effect in Schistosoma mansoni-infected mice. To determine the protective effect of PZQ-wogonin treatment on S. manosni-infected mice, histopathological analysis was done to evaluate the granuloma size and fibrotic areas in the liver. Western blotting was performed to analyze several injuries-related markers including fibrotic markers, inflammasomes, and apoptotic markers. Scanning electron microscopy was done to evaluate the effect of wogonin on the worms, and the worm and egg burden was calculated. Our results showed that PZQ-wogonin treatment significantly improved liver histopathology of S. mansoni-infected mice. Further analysis showed that PZQ-wogonin combinations are more effective in reducing fibrosis, inflammation, and apoptosis in the liver than that of individual drug use. Furthermore, our results revealed that wogonin is anthelmintic; and it works better with PZQ in reducing hepatic egg burden, further lessen the disease progression.

The treatment is based on only one drug, praziquantel, a drug discovered in the 1970s that shows moderate efficacy against the adult parasite, but low efficacy against the larval stages of the parasite. Therefore, the use of only one drug has brought concerns and losses on drug-resistance cases, necessitating the development of new effective chemotherapeutic agents against Schistosoma species. One of the strategies that have been implemented in drug development is the computer-aided drug design (CADD), investigating the structural characteristics of the compounds and targets in order to understand their actions and biological activities through 3D virtual manipulation, as the QSAR applied to ligands and molecular docking applied to a respective biological target. These studies help to extract information and characteristics relevant to the activity, as well as to predict potential applications and activity. Therefore, this chapter will present the main validated biological targets of the genus Schistosoma, as thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), histone deacetylases (HDAC 1, HDAC 8), dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, sirtuin protein and cathepsin L1, as well as reports of CADD in literature applied to the development of drugs against schistosomiasis, providing compounds with high pharmacological potential and high specificity."

This scenario, however, may not cover the effects of intrinsic, e.g., aging-related, (physiological) neurodegeneration of normal brain tissue. The aim of the work was to study the repeatability of radiomic features extracted from an apparently normal area in longitudinally acquired T1-weighted MR brain images using three different intensity normalization approaches typically used in radiomics: Z-score, WhiteStripe and Nyul. Fifty-nine images of hearing impaired, yet cognitively intact, patients were repeatedly acquired in two different time points within six months. Ninety-one radiomic features were obtained from an area within the pons region, considered to be a healthy brain tissue according to previous analyses and reports. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) in the repeatability study were used as metrics. Features extracted from the MRI normalized with Z-score showed results comparable in both ICC (0.90 (0.82-0.98)) and CCC (0.82 (0.69-0.95)) distribution values, in terms of median and quartiles, with those extracted from the images normalized with WhiteStripe (0.89 (0.84-0.92)) and (0.80 (0.73-0.84)), respectively.

When applying radiomics, imbalanced or small dataset issues are commonly addressed using under or over-sampling, the latter being applied directly to the extracted features. Aim of this study is to propose a novel balancing and data augmentation technique by applying perturbations (erosion, dilation, contour randomization) to the ROI in cardiac computed tomography images. From the perturbed ROIs, radiomic features are extracted, thus creating additional samples. This approach was tested addressing the clinical problem of distinguishing cardiac amyloidosis (CA) from aortic stenosis (AS) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Twenty-one CA, thirty-two AS and twenty-one HCM patients were included in the study. From each original and perturbed ROI, 107 radiomic features were extracted. The CA-AS dataset was balanced using the perturbation-based method along with random over-sampling, adaptive synthetic (ADASYN) and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The same methods were tested to perform data augmentation dealing with CA and HCM. Features were submitted to robustness, redundancy, and relevance analysis testing five feature selection methods (p-value, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), semi-supervised LASSO, principal component analysis (PCA), semi-supervised PCA). Support vector machine performed the classification tasks, and its performance were evaluated by means of a 10-fold cross-validation. The perturbation-based approach provided the best performances in terms of f1 score and balanced accuracy in both CA-AS (f1 score: 80%, AUC: 0.91) and CA-HCM (f1 score: 86%, AUC: 0.92) classifications. These results suggest that ROI perturbations represent a powerful approach to address both data balancing and augmentation issues."

This study is aimed to investigate the sensitivity of radiomics features extracted from 2 different pipelines, namely, Pyradiomics and RaCat, as well as the impact of gray-level discretization on the discovery of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) biomarkers. A retrospective cohort of 164 non-small cell lung cancer patients administered with ICIs was used in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from the pre-treatment CT scans. Univariate models were used to assess the association of common radiomics features between 2 libraries with progression-free survival (PFS), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (CD8 counts). In addition, we also examined the impact of gray-level discretization incorporated in Pyradiomics on the robustness of features across various clinical endpoints. We extracted 1224, 441 radiomic features using Pyradiomics and RaCat, respectively. Among these, 75 features were found to be common between the 2 libraries. Our analysis revealed that the directionality of association between radiomic features and clinical endpoints is highly dependent on the library. Notably, a larger number of Pyradiomics features were statistically associated with PFS, whereas RaCat features showed a stronger association with PD-L1 expression. Furthermore, intensity-based features were found to have a consistent association with clinical endpoints regardless of the gray-level discretization parameters in Pyradiomics-extracted features. This study highlights the heterogeneity of radiomics libraries and the gray-level discretization parameters that will impact the feature selection and predictive model development for biomarkers. Importantly, our work highlights the significance of standardizing radiomic features to facilitate translational studies that use imaging as an endpoint. Our study emphasizes the need to select stable CT-derived handcrafted features to build immunotherapy biomarkers, which is a necessary precursor for multi-institutional validation of imaging biomarkers."

CT images and clinical data from 141 ICH patients from 2010 to 2022 were collected. The cohort comprised primary (n = 57), tumorous (n = 46), and vascular malformation-related ICH (n = 38). Radiomics features were extracted from the initial brain NCCT scans and identified potential features using mutual information. A hierarchical classification with AdaBoost classifiers was employed to classify the multiple etiologies of ICH. Age of the patient and ICH's location were examined alongside radiomics features. The accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were used to evaluate classification performance. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of 0.79. For identifying primary ICH, the model achieved a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.87. Meanwhile, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying tumoral causes were 0.78 and 0.93, respectively. For vascular malformation, the model reached a sensitivity and specificity of 0.72 and 0.89, respectively. The AUCs for primary, tumorous, and vascular malformation were 0.86, 0.85, and 0.82, respectively. The findings further highlight the importance of texture-based variables in ICH classification. The age and location of the ICH can enhance the classification performance. The use of a machine learning model with radiomics features has the potential in classifying the three types of non-traumatic ICH. It may help the radiologist decide on an appropriate further examination plan to arrive at a correct diagnosis."

Radiomics features were extracted using MaZda software (version 4.6), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was employed for feature selection. Significant differences were observed in the training set between benign and malignant pGGNs in sex, mean CT value, margin, pleural retraction, tumor-lung interface, and internal vascular change, and then the mean CT value and the morphological features model were constructed. Fourteen radiomics features were selected by LASSO for the radiomics model. The combined model was developed by integrating all selected radiographic and radiomics features using logistic regression.

Novel image analysis approaches have enabled us to capture patterns from images imperceptible by the human eye. This rich source of data can be combined with a range of clinical features, holding the potential to be a noninvasive source of biomarkers. Applications of radiomics in skull base pathologies have centered around three common tumor classes: meningioma, sellar/parasellar tumors, and vestibular schwannomas. Radiomic investigations can be categorized into five domains: tumor detection/segmentation, classification between tumor types, tumor grading, detection of tumor features, and prognostication. Various computational architectures have been employed across these domains, with deep-learning methods becoming more common versus machine learning. Across radiomic applications, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI images remain the most utilized sequence for model development. Efforts to standardize and connect radiomic features to tumor biology have facilitated more clinically applicable radiomic models. Despite the advancement in model performance, several challenges continue to hinder translatability, including small sample sizes and model training on homogenous single institution data. To recognize the potential of radiomics for skull base oncology, prospective, multi-institutional collaboration will be the cornerstone for a validated radiomic technology."

Through the analysis of high-dimensional imaging data, radiomics models may capture subtle phenotypic variations in tumour heterogeneity, texture, and shape that extend beyond the capabilities of traditional imaging interpretation. CT-based radiomics excels in evaluating the prognostic significance of peritoneal disease dissemination and treatment response, while MRI-based models provide enhanced soft tissue characterisation, particularly in assessing tumour microstructure, vascularity, and cellularity. Studies demonstrate that these models can improve diagnostic accuracy, predict therapeutic outcomes and assist in risk stratification. However, standardisation of imaging acquisition protocols, feature extraction techniques and validation across diverse patient cohorts remains a challenge for the incorporation of radiomics into routine clinical practice. Evidence strongly supports the incorporation of radiomic features with molecular, genomic and clinical data in developing high-performance integrated radiomics models, which can facilitate precision oncology in ovarian cancer."

The conventional perspective on radiomics encompassing segmentation and the extraction of radiomic features considers it as an independent and sequential process. However, it is not necessary to adhere to this viewpoint. In this study, we show that besides generating masks from which radiomic features can be extracted, prostate segmentation and reconstruction models provide valuable information in their feature space, which can improve the quality of radiomic signatures models for disease aggressiveness classification. We perform 2,244 experiments with deep learning features extracted from 13 different models trained using different anatomic zones and characterize how modeling decisions, such as deep feature aggregation and dimensionality reduction, affect performance. While models using deep features from full gland and radiomic features consistently lead to improved disease aggressiveness prediction performance, others are detrimental. Our results suggest that the use of deep features can be beneficial, but an appropriate and comprehensive assessment is necessary to ensure that their inclusion does not harm predictive performance. The study findings reveal that incorporating deep features derived from autoencoder models trained to reconstruct the full prostate gland (both zonal models show worse performance than radiomics only models), combined with radiomic features, often lead to a statistically significant increase in model performance for disease aggressiveness classification. Additionally, the results also demonstrate that the choice of feature selection is key to achieving good performance, with principal component analysis (PCA) and PCA + relief being the best approaches and that there is no clear difference between the three proposed latent representation extraction techniques."

          "abstract": "Radiomics features have been widely used as novel biomarkers in the diagnosis of various diseases, but whether radiomics features derived from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images can evaluate muscle atrophy has not been studied. Therefore, this study aims to establish a new biomarker based on H&E images using radiomics methods to quantitatively analyze H&E images, which is crucial for improving the accuracy of muscle atrophy assessment. Firstly, a weightless muscle atrophy model was established by laying macaques in bed, and H&E images of the shank muscle fibers of the control and bed rest (BR) macaques were collected. Muscle fibers were accurately segmented by designing a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on contrastive learning. Then, 77 radiomics features were extracted from the segmented muscle fibers, and a stable subset of features was selected through the LASSO method. Finally, the correlation between radiomics features and muscle atrophy was analyzed using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The semi-supervised segmentation results show that the proposed method had an average Spearman's and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 88% and 86% compared to manually extracted features, respectively. Radiomics analysis showed that the AUC of the muscle atrophy evaluation model based on H&E images was 96.87%. For individual features, GLSZM_SZE outperformed other features in terms of AUC (91.5%) and ACC (84.4%). In summary, the feature extraction based on the semi-supervised segmentation method is feasible and reliable for subsequent radiomics research. Texture features have greater advantages in evaluating muscle atrophy compared to other features. This study provides important biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of muscle atrophy."

The field of \"Radiomics\" involves the extraction of high-dimensional features, often referred to as \"Radiomic features,\" from digital radiological images. This survey offers an analysis of the current state of research in PA radiomics. Our work comprises a systematic review of 34 publications focused on PA radiomics and other automated information mining pertaining to PA through the analysis of radiological data using computer vision methods. We begin with a theoretical exploration essential for understanding the theoretical background of radionmics, encompassing traditional approaches from computer vision and machine learning, as well as the latest methodologies in deep radiomics utilizing deep learning (DL). Thirty-four research works under examination are comprehensively compared and evaluated. The overall results achieved in the analyzed papers are high, e.g., the best accuracy is up to 96% and the best achieved AUC is up to 0.99, which establishes optimism for the successful use of radiomic features. Methods based on deep learning seem to be the most promising for the future. In relation to this perspective DL methods, several challenges are remarkable: It is important to create high-quality and sufficiently extensive datasets necessary for training deep neural networks. Interpretability of deep radiomics is also a big open challenge. It is necessary to develop and verify methods that will explain to us how deep radiomic features reflect various physics-explainable aspects."

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), as a new treatment method, can affect the course of many chronic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, malignant tumor, autoimmune disease and nervous system disease. Although the mechanism of action of FMT is now well understood, there is some controversy in metabolic diseases, so its clinical application may be limited. Microflora transplantation is recommended by clinical medical guidelines and consensus for the treatment of recurrent or refractory <i>Clostridium difficile</i> infection, and has been gradually promoted for the treatment of other intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. However, the initial results are varied, suggesting that the heterogeneity of the donor stools may affect the efficacy of FMT. The success of FMT depends on the microbial diversity and composition of donor feces. Therefore, clinical trials may fail due to the selection of ineffective donors, and not to faulty indication selection for FMT. A new understanding is that FMT not only improves insulin sensitivity, but may also alter the natural course of type 1 diabetes by modulating autoimmunity. In this review, we focus on the main mechanisms and deficiencies of FMT, and explore the optimal design of FMT research, especially in the field of cardiometabolic diseases."

Changes observed in the recipient's biology are routinely attributed to bacterial cells in the donor feces (~1011 per gram of human wet stool). Here, we examine the literature and summarize findings on the composition of fecal matter in order to raise cautiously the profile of its multipart nature. In addition to viable bacteria, which may make up a small fraction of total fecal matter, other components in unprocessed human feces include colonocytes (~107 per gram of wet stool), archaea (~108 per gram of wet stool), viruses (~108 per gram of wet stool), fungi (~106 per gram of wet stool), protists, and metabolites. Thus, while speculative at this point and contingent on the transplant procedure and study system, nonbacterial matter could contribute to changes in the recipient's biology. There is a cautious need for continued reductionism to separate out the effects and interactions of each component."

The \"gut microbial organ\" from the donor that is used in these transplants may serve to transfer genetic material between donor and recipient via virus-like particles, specifically bacteriophages, that infect the bacterial component of the microbiota. The recently published study by Chehoud et al. provides evidence for not only the transfer of bacteriophages during FMT but also the transfer of multiple populations of bacteriophages to recipients from the donor microbiota used (C. Chehoud et al., mBio 7:e00322-16, 2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00322-16). While the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear, nothing short of a diligent and persistent effort is needed to define the intended and unintended consequences of FMT."

Rarely has one treatment provided the opportunity to treat a myriad of diseases, not only within the gastrointestinal tract but also in extra-intestinal organs; such is the power of the gastrointestinal microbiota to modulate the immune system and eradicate infections, even where antibiotics have previously failed. The demand for this therapy, both among patients and physicians, is increasing, and a search of the literature reveals numerous reviews, case reports and discussion on the topic. However, to date, much of the literature addresses the procedure from a physician's point of view, and can therefore be lacking in practical detail. As nurses are often the 'unsung heroes' of the procedure, it is timely to address the subject from a nursing perspective."

FMT have also demonstrated the capacity to modulate the collection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), termed the resistome, within the gut. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate the literature regarding the interaction between FMT and the gut resistome and determine whether FMT could be used specifically to reduce ARG carriage in the gut. Several studies have demonstrated a decrease in ARG carriage post-FMT administration in various disease states, including recurrent C. difficile infection and after antibiotic usage. However, other studies have reported an expansion of the resistome following FMT. Most studies contained small patient cohorts regardless of the outcome and showed heterogeneity in responses. Research on resistome modulation by FMT is preliminary, and human studies currently lack consensus regarding benefits and risks. From a safety perspective, screening donor samples for ARGs in addition to antibiotic-resistant organisms may be advisable. Additional studies on the mechanisms underlying heterogeneity between studies and individuals are required before FMT is considered an efficient approach for resistome amelioration."

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in IBD patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (a) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) (Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11) and (b) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors), and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, 1 week, and 1 month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from five individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (three out of four UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (area under the curve > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy."

This study consisted of a 24-week open-label observational study of children and adolescents who had completed either of two 10-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. The Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) was the primary measure of efficacy. Two hundred ninety nine (299) patients completed the acute studies and were eligible for the extension study. Of these, 226 enrolled, but 5 did not receive treatment. Of 221 patients (107 children and 114 adolescents), 62.4% completed the study. The endpoint mean daily dose was 109.9 mg/day. The mean decrease in CDRS-R score from double-blind baseline was 34.8 points (p < 0.001), with patients showing continued improvement in CDRS-R scores regardless of which treatment they received in the double-blind studies. At endpoint, 86% of patients met CDRS-R responder and 58% CDRS-R remitter criteria. Sertraline appears to be well tolerated and safe over 24 weeks of treatment in children and adolescents with MDD. Children and adolescents treated with sertraline appear to have increased improvement over that seen in the first 10 weeks of treatment. These findings need confirmation in placebo-controlled studies."

Sertraline is well tolerated and its safety profile in overdose is favorable. However, sertraline overdose may cause a toxic hyperserotonergic state known as serotonin syndrome (SS). Serotonin syndrome may be misdiagnosed in children because it has been reported mostly in adults. In the present case report, we describe a 16-year-old female patient who ingested 2000 mg of sertraline to attempt suicide. The patient showed symptoms and signs suggestive of SS, characterized by an asynchronicity between organic and psychiatric symptoms. In addition, the patient showed a variability of psychiatric symptoms through time. Thirteen hours after sertraline overdose, she was poorly cooperative with poverty of speech and marked emotional tension, but she was oriented in space and time and was able to remember what happened to her and to reconstruct the dynamics of the fact. Twenty-four hours after sertraline overdose, the patient developed a delusion of reference associated with intense anxiety and depressed mood. In the present case report, we discuss the pathophysiologic mechanisms of the observed clinical manifestations and propose an observation period for sertraline overdose in children and adolescents that is sufficiently long (at least 72 hours) even in the absence of unstable vital signs."

Both groups experienced significant improvement in posttraumatic stress disorder and other clinical outcomes from pre- to posttreatment with no significant group x time differences between groups except in Child Global Assessment Scale ratings, which favored the TF-CBT + sertraline group. Only minimal evidence suggests a benefit to adding sertraline to TF-CBT. A drawback of adding sertraline was determining whether TF-CBT or sertraline caused clinical improvement for children with comorbid depression. Current evidence therefore supports an initial trial of TF-CBT or other evidence-supported psychotherapy for most children with PTSD symptoms before adding medication."

The authors evaluated the efficacy of 6 months of treatment with low-dose sertraline in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 52 children with FXS aged 2 to 6 years. Eighty-one subjects were screened for eligibility, and 57 were randomized to sertraline (27) or placebo (30). Two subjects from the sertraline arm and 3 from the placebo arm discontinued. Intent-to-treat analysis showed no difference from placebo on the primary outcomes: the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) expressive language (EL) age equivalent and Clinical Global Impression Scale-Improvement. However, analyses of secondary measures showed significant improvements, particularly in motor and visual perceptual abilities and social participation. Sertraline was well tolerated, with no difference in side effects between sertraline and placebo groups. No serious adverse events occurred. This randomized controlled trial of 6 months of sertraline treatment showed no primary benefit with respect to early EL development and global clinical improvement. However, in secondary exploratory analyses, there were significant improvements seen on motor and visual perceptual subtests, the cognitive T score sum on the MSEL, and on one measure of social participation on the Sensory Processing Measure-Preschool. Furthermore, post hoc analysis found significant improvement in early EL development as measured by the MSEL among children with autism spectrum disorder on sertraline. Treatment appears safe for this 6-month period in young children with FXS, but the authors do not know the long-term side effects of this treatment. These results warrant further studies of sertraline in young children with FXS using refined outcome measures as well as longer term follow-up studies to address long-term side effects of low-dose sertraline in early childhood."

This is the first controlled investigation based on our review of the early use of a medication to prevent PTSD in children. Twenty-six children aged 6-20 were assessed in a 24-week double-blind placebo-controlled design. Each child received either flexibly dosed sertraline between 25-150 mg/day or placebo. At each reassessment, information was collected in compliance with the study medication, parental assessment of the child's symptomatology and functioning, and the child's self-report of symptomatology. The protocol was approved by the Human Studies Committees of Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriners Hospitals for Children. The final sample was 17 subjects who received sertraline versus 9 placebo control subjects matched for age, severity of injury, and type of hospitalization.

We performed a prospective, multicenter study to assess efficiency and safety of the serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline in treating children with refractory cholestatic pruritus. Twenty children experiencing refractory cholestatic pruritus related to Alagille syndrome or progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis were included from 4 centers between 2007 and 2014, and treated with sertraline at a starting dose of 1 mg · kg · day and thereafter individually adapted up to 4 mg · kg · day. Before and after 3 months with therapy, pruritus was assessed using a visual itching scale graded on 10 points, a skin scratch marks score and a sleeping impairment score. Sertraline was prescribed at a median daily dose of 2.2 mg · kg · day. After 3 months, pruritus improved in 14 out of 20 treated patients, and the median itching score decreased significantly from 8/10 (5-10) to 5/10 (2-10). Likewise, skin scratch marks and sleep quality improved in 9 of these 14 patients. Nonsevere adverse events were reported in 6 children, leading to treatment discontinuation in 3.

          "abstract": "Misfolded and aggregated proteins build up in neurodegenerative illnesses, which causes neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neuronal death. In the last few years, there has been a significant upsurge in the level of interest towards the function of molecular chaperones in the control of misfolding and aggregation. The crucial molecular chaperones implicated in neurodegenerative illnesses are covered in this review article, along with a variety of their different methods of action. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones serve critical roles in preserving protein homeostasis. By aiding in protein folding, avoiding misfolding, and enabling protein breakdown, molecular chaperones have integral roles in preserving regulation of protein balance. It has been demonstrated that aging, a significant risk factor for neurological disorders, affects how molecular chaperones function. The aggregation of misfolded proteins and the development of neurodegeneration may be facilitated by the aging-related reduction in chaperone activity. Molecular chaperones have also been linked to the pathophysiology of several instances of neuron withering illnesses, enumerating as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Molecular chaperones have become potential therapy targets concerning with the prevention and therapeutic approach for brain disorders due to their crucial function in protein homeostasis and their connection to neurodegenerative illnesses. Protein homeostasis can be restored, and illness progression can be slowed down by methods that increase chaperone function or modify their expression. This review emphasizes the importance of molecular chaperones in the context of neuron withering disorders and their potential as therapeutic targets for brain disorders."

          "abstract": "A hallmark event in neurodegenerative diseases is the accumulation of misfolded aggregated proteins in the brain leading to neuronal dysfunction and disease. Compelling evidence suggests that misfolded proteins damage cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and alterations in calcium homeostasis. Changes in cytoplasmic calcium concentration lead to unbalances on several signaling pathways. Recent data suggest that calcium-mediated hyperactivation of calcineurin (CaN), a key phosphatase in the brain, triggers synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, the two central events responsible for brain degeneration in neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, blocking CaN hyper-activation might be a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent brain damage in neurodegenerative diseases."

          "abstract": "Accumulation of misfolded/unfolded aggregated proteins in the brain is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases affecting humans and animals. Dysregulation of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and disruption of fast axonal transport (FAT) are early pathological events that lead to loss of synaptic integrity and axonal degeneration in early stages of neurodegenerative diseases. Dysregulated Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the brain is triggered by accumulation of misfolded/unfolded aggregated proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a major Ca<sup>2+</sup> storing organelle, ultimately leading to neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Calcineurin (CaN), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, has been implicated in T cells activation through the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). In addition to the involvement of several other signaling cascades, CaN has been shown to play a role in early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Therefore, inhibiting hyperactivated CaN in early stages of disease might be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating patients with protein misfolding diseases. In this review, we briefly summarize the structure of CaN, inhibition mechanisms by which immunosuppressants inhibit CaN, role of CaN in maintaining neuronal and synaptic integrity and homeostasis and the role played by CaN in protein unfolding/misfolding neurodegenerative diseases."

          "abstract": "Many major neurodegenerative diseases, including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington Disease and other polyglutamine expansion disorders, are associated with degeneration and death of specific neuronal populations due to accumulation of certain abnormal polypeptides. These misfolded species aggregate and form inclusion bodies and their neurotoxicity is associated with the aggregation. To handle a build-up of abnormal proteins cells employ a complicated machinery of molecular chaperones and various proteolytic systems. Chaperones facilitate refolding or degradation of misfolded polypeptides, prevent protein aggregation and play a role in formation of aggresome, a centrosome-associated body to which small cytoplasmic aggregates are transported. The ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic system is critical for reducing the levels of soluble abnormal proteins, while autophagy plays the major role in clearing of cells from protein aggregates. Accumulation of the aggregation prone proteins activates signal transduction pathways that control cell death, including JNK pathway that controls viability of a cell in various models of Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. The major chaperone Hsp72 can interfere with this signalling pathway, thus promoting survival. A very important consequence of a build-up and aggregation of misfolded proteins is impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system and suppression of the heat shock response. Such an inhibition of the major cell defense systems may play a critical role in neurodegeneration. Here, it is suggested that these changes may reflect a senescence-like programme initiated by the aggregated abnormal polypeptides. Pathways that control the fate of misfolded proteins, for example molecular chaperones or proteolytic systems, may become interesting novel targets for therapy of neurodegenerative disorders."

Understanding the mechanisms of neuronal cell death during pathogenesis of diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases is key to addressing the options for treatment and prevention of brain deterioration. One feature of many such diseases is the accumulation of specific misfolded proteins. Often these misfolded proteins take the form of large amyloid fibrils or plaques, but recent observations implicate small soluble oligomers as the primary causes of neuronal dysfunction. How these misfolded proteins trigger cell death pathways is largely unknown, but some reports have suggested mediation by normal cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>).

          "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological deposits of β-amyloid (Aβ) in senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprising hyperphosphorylated aggregated tau, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Substantial evidence indicates that disrupted neuronal calcium homeostasis is an early event in AD that could mediate synaptic dysfunction and neuronal toxicity. Sodium calcium exchangers (NCXs) play important roles in regulating intracellular calcium, and accumulating data suggests that reduced NCX function, following aberrant proteolytic cleavage of these exchangers, may contribute to neurodegeneration. Here, we show that elevated calpain, but not caspase-3, activity is a prominent feature of AD brain. In addition, we observe increased calpain-mediated cleavage of NCX3, but not a related family member NCX1, in AD brain relative to unaffected tissue and that from other neurodegenerative conditions. Moreover, the extent of NCX3 proteolysis correlated significantly with amounts of Aβ1-42. We also show that exposure of primary cortical neurons to oligomeric Aβ1-42 results in calpain-dependent cleavage of NCX3, and we demonstrate that loss of NCX3 function is associated with Aβ toxicity. Our findings suggest that Aβ mediates calpain cleavage of NCX3 in AD brain and therefore that reduced NCX3 activity could contribute to the sustained increases in intraneuronal calcium concentrations that are associated with synaptic and neuronal dysfunction in AD."

Due to the lack of suitable animal models, studies examining the events involved in the neurodegeneration have relied on postmortem human brain tissue obtained from individuals with the disease and from normal controls. However, it is uncertain if the neuronal cytoskeleton is stable during the postmortem interval. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblots were used to examine the microtubule-associated proteins tau, MAP2, and MAP1B in the rat hippocampus at various times after death. Shortly after death, tau immunoreactivity was lost from axons and accumulated in somatodendritic compartments. MAP2 and MAP1B also accumulated in neuronal cell bodies prior to a loss of immunostaining in some regions, notably subiculum. Immunoblots confirmed a loss of MAP2 and MAP1B within a few hours after death. Tau levels remained constant during the 8-hour postmortem interval examined, although the electrophoretic mobility of some tau bands was altered. Human brain tissue obtained at autopsy and at surgery demonstrated similar cytoskeletal alterations in postmortem tissue. These results demonstrate that microtubules and associated proteins are not stable postmortem."

          "abstract": "Perinatal asphyxia is a complex disease involving massive death of brain cells in full-term newborns. The most impressive consequence of perinatal asphyxia is a neurodegenerative brain injury called hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Management of newborns after perinatal asphyxia is very difficult due to the lack of measurable biomarkers that would be able to assess the severity of the brain injury in the future, help in the selection of therapy, assess the results of treatment and determine the prognosis for the future. Thus, these limitations make long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes unpredictable during life. Quantifying biomarkers that can detect subclinical changes at a stage where routine brain monitoring or imaging is still mute would be a major advance in the care of neonates with brain neurodegeneration after asphyxia. Understanding the effect of perinatal asphyxia on changes in blood neurodegenerative biomarkers over time, which would be commonly used to assess the severity of postpartum encephalopathy, would be an important step in developing precision in predicting the consequences of brain injuries. We urgently need more accurate early predictive markers to guide clinicians when to use neuroprotective therapy. The needed neurodegenerative biomarkers may represent neuronal pathological changes that can be recognized by new technologies such as genomic and proteomic. Nevertheless, the simultaneous blood tau protein and various amyloid changes with the addition of an autophagy marker beclin 1 after perinatal asphyxia have not been studied. We decided to evaluate serum biomarkers of neuronal injury characteristic for Alzheimer's disease such as amyloid peptides (1-38, 1-40 and 1-42), tau protein and beclin 1, which can predict the progression of brain neurodegeneration in future. In this paper, we report for the first time the significant changes in the above molecules in the blood after asphyxia compared to healthy controls during the 1-7, 8-14 and 15+ days ELISA test."

          "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) increases the informational content of the genome and is more prevalent in the brain than in any other tissue. The splicing factor Tra2b (Sfrs10) can modulate splicing inclusion of exons by specifically detecting GAA-rich binding motifs and its absence causes early embryonic lethality in mice. TRA2B has been shown to be involved in splicing processes of Nasp (nuclear autoantigenic sperm protein), MAPT (microtubule associated protein tau) and SMN (survival motor neuron), and is therefore implicated in spermatogenesis and neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease and spinal muscular atrophy. Here we generated a neuronal-specific Tra2b knock-out mouse that lacks Tra2b expression in neuronal and glial precursor cells by using the Nestin-Cre. Neuronal-specific Tra2b knock-out mice die immediately after birth and show severe abnormalities in cortical development, which are caused by massive apoptotic events in the ventricular layers of the cortex, demonstrating a pivotal role of Tra2b for the developing central nervous system. Using whole brain RNA on exon arrays we identified differentially expressed alternative exons of Tubulinδ1 and Shugoshin-like2 as in vivo targets of Tra2b. Most interestingly, we found increased expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1a (p21) which we could functionally link to neuronal precursor cells in the affected brain regions. We provide further evidence that the absence of Tra2b causes p21 upregulation and ultimately cell death in NSC34 neuronal-like cells. These findings demonstrate that Tra2b regulates splicing events essential for maintaining neuronal viability during development. Apoptotic events triggered via p21 might not be restricted to the developing brain but could possibly be generalized to the whole organism and explain early embryonic lethality in Tra2b-depleted mice."

          "abstract": "The transitioning of cells during the systemic demise of an organism is poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that organismal death is accompanied by a common and sequential molecular flood of stress-induced events that propagate the senescence phenotype, and this phenotype is preserved in the proteome after death. We demonstrate activation of \"death\" pathways involvement in diseases of ageing, with biochemical mechanisms mapping onto neurological damage, embryonic development, the inflammatory response, cardiac disease and ultimately cancer with increased significance. There is sufficient bioavailability of the building blocks required to support the continued translation, energy, and functional catalytic activity of proteins. Significant abundance changes occur in 1258 proteins across 1 to 720 h post-mortem of the 12-week-old mouse mandible. Protein abundance increases concord with enzyme activity, while mitochondrial dysfunction is evident with metabolic reprogramming. This study reveals differences in protein abundances which are akin to states of stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). The control of these pathways is significant for a large number of biological scenarios. Understanding how these pathways function during the process of cellular death holds promise in generating novel solutions capable of overcoming disease complications, maintaining organ transplant viability and could influence the findings of proteomics through \"deep-time\" of individuals with no historically recorded cause of death."

To test this hypothesis, we investigated the impact of cumulative genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder on functional brain connectivity in a balanced sample of boys and girls with autism spectrum disorder and typically developing boys and girls (127 youth, ages 8-17). Brain connectivity analyses focused on the salience network, a core intrinsic functional connectivity network which has previously been implicated in autism spectrum disorder. The effects of polygenic risk on salience network functional connectivity were significantly modulated by participant sex, with genetic load for autism spectrum disorder influencing functional connectivity in boys with and without autism spectrum disorder but not girls. These findings support the hypothesis that autism spectrum disorder risk genes interact with sex differential processes, thereby contributing to the male bias in autism prevalence and proposing an underlying neurobiological mechanism for the female protective effect."

Signs of concordance between the extremely low mental, affective and motor developmental levels, such as in the expression of the eyes, are a prominent feature of RS, whereas signs of higher cortical functions that are in contrast with insufficient relations to objects, people and space are a prominent characteristic in autism. It is argued that insistence on sameness, avoidance of social stimuli and self-injurious stereotypies of autistic children are neurotic reactions based on their insufficient object relations. On the basis of the clinical findings a theory is proposed, according to which there exists a system for involuntary contributions to the affective engagement in perception, which is insufficiently developed in autism and in earlier stages of RS.

This study aimed to investigate domain-specific associations between autistic traits and EBCs-including anxiety, affective, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, and oppositional-defiant problems-across childhood in autistic boys and girls. We prospectively followed 389 children (84% male) diagnosed with autism at ages 2-5 years, using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) across eight timepoints until age 12. Moderated nonlinear factor analysis was used to identify and adjust for measurement non-invariance of SRS items by age, sex, and EBCs. The adjusted scores were then used for sex-moderated time-varying modeling of associations between autistic traits and EBCs. Several SRS items in the domains of social-interaction difficulties and repetitive mannerisms showed significant intercept bias by age and level of co-occurring anxiety and ADHD (effect size r > 0.20). In autistic boys, strong associations were observed between social-communication difficulties and EBCs around ages 7-9, which tended to diminish in late childhood. In contrast, autistic girls showed stable or intensifying associations, particularly with anxiety, into late childhood. Results revealed significant associations between autistic traits and EBCs after addressing item-level measurement biases. The varying associations over time highlight the importance of continuous monitoring to promptly address autistic children's sex-differential mental health needs. These findings emphasize the benefits of refining behavioral constructs and adopting a nuanced developmental approach to identify critical periods of symptom coupling/decoupling for informing evaluation and service provision."

To examine the distribution and genetic structure of autistic traits in the general population using a newly established quantitative measure of autistic traits, the Social Responsiveness Scale (formerly known as the Social Reciprocity Scale). The sample consisted of 788 pairs of twins aged 7 to 15 years, randomly selected from the pool of participants in a large epidemiologic study (the Missouri Twin Study). One parent of each pair of twins completed the Social Responsiveness Scale on each child. The data were subjected to structural equation modeling. Autistic traits as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale were continuously distributed and moderately to highly heritable. Levels of severity of autistic traits at or above the previously published mean for patients with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified were found in 1.4% of boys and 0.3% of girls. Structural equation modeling revealed no evidence for the existence of sex-specific genetic influences, and suggested specific mechanisms by which females may be relatively protected from vulnerability to autistic traits. These data indicate that the social deficits characteristic of autism spectrum disorders are common. Given the continuous distribution of these traits, it may be arbitrary where cutoffs are made between research designations of being \"affected\" vs \"unaffected\" with a pervasive developmental disorder. The genes influencing autistic traits appear to be the same for boys and girls. Lower prevalence (and severity) of autistic traits in girls may be the result of increased sensitivity to early environmental influences that operate to promote social competency."

In normal serum, about 80% is IgG, 15% is IgA, 5% is IgM, 0.2% is IgD and a trace is IgE. Quantitative serum immunoglobulin tests are used to detect abnormal levels of the three major classes (IgG, IgA and IgM). Testing is used to help diagnose various conditions and diseases that affect the levels of one or more of these immunoglobulin classes. Some conditions cause excess levels, some cause deficiencies, and others cause a combination of increased and decreased levels. IgD and IgE will not be discussed in this article."

Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are glycoproteins and are divided into five major classes. IgG, which composes approximately 75% of the immunoglobulins in human serum, is most commonly used for immunostaining. Two types of detection systems, fluorescent and enzyme based are used for immunostaining. The choice of detection system depends on the type of sample and the availability of fluorescent or bight field microscopes as well as the type of information the investigator would like to obtain. This chapter provides an overview of antibody characteristics, and their use in immunostaining."

The levels of immunoglobulins of all classes (mainly IgA and IgG) were shown to be elevated in the process of the disease. The dynamics of the increase in the level of IgA (both general and secretory) was supposed to indicate the formation of local immunity in the intestinal wall. The presence of serum IgA and the characteristic IgG dynamics seemed to be indicative of destructive processes occurring in the intestinal wall. Thus, the dynamics of accumulation of immunoglobulins in coprofiltrates obtained from patients with alimentary toxicoinfections reflects the main local pathological and immunological processes."

The rest of immunoglobulins studied are normally present in equine tear fluid (though in lower concentration) and contribute to ocular surface immune protection. Female and adult horses showed significant higher mean IgA concentration than male and young horses.

          "abstract": "Lemborexant (LEM) is a dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) approved in multiple countries including the USA, Japan, Canada, Australia, and several Asian countries for the treatment of insomnia in adults. As a compound with central nervous system activity, it is important to understand the abuse potential of LEM with respect to public health. This review discusses data for LEM relevant to each of the 8 factors of the United States Controlled Substances Act. LEM did not demonstrate abuse potential in nonclinical testing and was associated with a low incidence of abuse-related adverse events in clinical study participants with insomnia disorder. Similar to other DORAs that have been evaluated (eg., almorexant, suvorexant (SUV), and daridorexant), LEM and the positive controls (zolpidem and SUV) also showed drug liking in a phase 1 abuse potential study that enrolled subjects who used sedatives recreationally. However, internet surveillance of SUV and the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System suggests that drugs in the DORA class display very low abuse-related risks in the community. Additionally, as described in FDA-approved labeling, it does not carry physical dependence and withdrawal risks. LEM, similar to most other prescription insomnia medications, was placed into Schedule IV. However, LEM and other drugs in the DORA class may have a lower potential for abuse as suggested by real-world postmarketing data from federal surveys and internet surveillance, and thus may have lower risks to public health than Schedule IV benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics that potentiate GABA signaling."

          "abstract": "Insomnia-related sleep disruption can contribute to impaired learning and memory. Treatment of insomnia should ideally improve the sleep profile while minimally affecting mnemonic function, yet many hypnotic drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines) are known to impair memory. Here, we used a rat model of insomnia to determine whether the novel hypnotic drug DORA-22, a dual orexin receptor antagonist, improves mild stress-induced insomnia with minimal effect on memory. Animals were first trained to remember the location of a hidden platform (acquisition) in the Morris Water Maze and then administered DORA-22 (10, 30, or 100 mg/kg doses) or vehicle control. Animals were then subjected to a rodent insomnia model involving two exposures to dirty cages over a 6-hr time period (at time points 0 and 3 hr), followed immediately by a probe trial in which memory of the water maze platform location was evaluated. DORA-22 treatment improved the insomnia-related sleep disruption-wake was attenuated and NREM sleep was normalized. REM sleep amounts were enhanced compared with vehicle treatment for one dose (30 mg/kg). In the first hour of insomnia model exposure, DORA-22 promoted the number and average duration of NREM sleep spindles, which have been previously proposed to play a role in memory consolidation (all doses). Water maze measures revealed probe trial performance improvement for select doses of DORA-22, including increased time spent in the platform quadrant (10 and 30 mg/kg) and time spent in platform location and number of platform crossings (10 mg/kg only). In conclusion, DORA-22 treatment improved insomnia-related sleep disruption and memory consolidation deficits."

          "abstract": "The World Health Organization's Essential Drug List (EDL) contains first-in-class drugs and subsequent class entrants (follow-on drugs) deemed necessary to combat diseases prevalent throughout the world, with a special emphasis on developing nations. The EDL also includes originally approved and follow-on indications. There are opposing views regarding the value of follow-on drugs and indications. Critics suggest many follow-on drugs and indications offer little or no benefit to patients. Advocates counter that follow-on drugs offer advantages in terms of improved effectiveness, compliance and patient satisfaction. In order to inform this debate on the value of follow-on drugs and indications we examined the numbers of follow-on drugs on the EDL and the extent to which follow-on indications are recommended. We identified all 312 drugs on the 14th edition of the EDL, omitting 72 non-pharmaceutical entities. For the 240 pharmaceutical entities we ascertained whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved them, and, if so, when each was approved. We chose a validated therapeutic classification system - the United States Pharmacopeia's Model Guidelines for Medicare formulary management - in order to distinguish first-in-class and follow-on drugs on the EDL. Specifically, we selected the formulary key drug type as our benchmark therapeutic class. We assigned each EDL drug to a formulary key drug type. We defined first-in-class drugs as the first in each formulary key drug type, and follow-on drugs as all other drugs in each formulary key drug type. We identified follow-on indications by comparing WHO-listed indications with the original approved indication(s) by the FDA. Finally, we examined the therapeutic rating (priority vs. standard) given by the FDA to follow-on drugs on the EDL. Sixty-three per cent of the EDL drugs were follow-ons; 15% of the indications were follow-on indications. Fourteen drugs were listed in multiple WHO (sub) groupings; and 49% of follow-on drugs were given a priority rating by the FDA. In light of the fact that the EDL only includes drugs and indications deemed essential, the large number of follow-on drugs, follow-on indications, and priority-rated follow-on drugs on the EDL suggest their importance. From a public policy perspective, it may prove counterproductive to erect hurdles that impede follow-on research and development."

There has been hardly any clinical research into them and they are not detectable in hospital laboratories. Three of these products, BZP (1- benzylpiperazine), mefedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) and Spice are probably the most widely used in Europe. The first two are consumed as an alternative to ecstasy and cocaine and are characterized by their producing a clinical profile of a sympathetic mimetic type; on occasion, they have serious consequences, with convulsions and even death. Spice (a mixture of herbs with synthetic cannabinoids such as JWH-018, JWH-073 and CP 47497-C8) is giving rise to profiles of dependence and schizophrenia.

Fifteen percent of the samples fail at least one test and can be considered substandard. After controlling for local factors, we find that failing drugs are priced 13.6-18.7% lower than non-failing drugs but the signaling effect of price is far from complete, especially for non-innovator brands. The look of the pharmacy, as assessed by our covert shoppers, is weakly correlated with the results of quality tests. These findings suggest that consumers are likely to suspect low quality from market price, non-innovator brand and the look of the pharmacy, but none of these signals can perfectly identify substandard and counterfeit drugs."

The classification in this report is based on the aqueous solubility of the drugs reported in commonly available reference literature and a correlation of human intestinal membrane permeability for a set of 29 reference drugs with their calculated partition coefficients. The WHO Essential Drug List consists of a total of 325 medicines and 260 drugs, of which 123 are oral drugs in immediate-release (IR) products. Drugs with dose numbers less than or equal to unity [Do = (maximum dose strength/250 mL)/solubility < or = 1] are defined as high-solubility drugs. Drug solubility for the uncharged, lowest-solubility form reported in the Merck Index or USP was used. Of the 123 WHO oral drugs in immediate-release dosage forms, 67% (82) were determined to be high-solubility drugs. The classification of permeability is based on correlations of human intestinal permeability of 29 reference drugs with the estimated log P or CLogP lipophilicity values. Metoprolol was chosen as the reference compound for permeability and log P or CLogP. Log P and CLogP were linearly correlated (r2 = 0.78) for 104 drugs. A total of 53 (43.1%) and 62 (50.4%) drugs on the WHO list exhibited log P and CLogP estimates, respectively, that were greater than or equal to the corresponding metoprolol value and are classified as high-permeability drugs. The percentages of the drugs in immediate-release dosage forms that were classified as BCS Class 1, Class 2, Class 3, and Class 4 drugs using dose number and log Pwere as follows: 23.6% in Class 1, 17.1% in Class 2, 31.7% in Class 3, and 10.6% in Class 4. The remaining 17.1% of the drugs could not be classified because of the inability to calculate log P values because of missing fragments. The corresponding percentages in the various BCS classes with dose number and CLogP criteria were similar: 28.5% in Class 1, 19.5% in Class 2, 35.0% in Class 3, and 9.8% in Class 4. The remaining 7.3% of the drugs could not be classified since CLogP could not be calculated. These results suggest that a satisfactory bioequivalence (BE) test for more than 55% of the high-solubility Class 1 and Class 3 drug products on the WHO Essential Drug List may be based on an in vitro dissolution test. The use of more easily implemented, routinely monitored, and reliable in vitro dissolution tests can ensure the clinical performance of drug products that appear on the WHO Essential Medicines List."

          "abstract": "In response to scrutiny over high drug prices, manufacturers of insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents for treating hepatitis C have recently introduced authorized generic alternatives to their patented brand-name products. These authorized generic drugs have list prices at least 50% lower than the list price of the brand-name drugs, which should result in savings to patients. However, it is unclear whether these authorized generic drugs are offered on Medicare Part D formularies because they may not provide savings to plans or Medicare. To assess Medicare Part D formulary coverage for 4 brand-name formulations of insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents and their authorized generic formulations. This cross-sectional study used Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Formulary and Pricing Information Files from quarter 3 of 2020 and Medicare Part D plan enrollment for September 2020. Four patented brand-name drugs (sofosbuvir and velpatasvir fixed-dose combination tablets [Epclusa], ledipasvir and sofosbuvir tablets [Harvoni], insulin lispro [Humalog], and insulin aspart [Novolog]) and their authorized generic formulations for all Part D stand-alone prescription drug plans (n = 959) and Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (n = 3148) were studied. Beneficiary-weighted formulary coverage of brand-name and authorized generic products; beneficiary out-of-pocket costs; and prerebate plan, manufacturer, and Medicare spending on brand-name and authorized generic products. In quarter 3 of 2020, 97% of beneficiaries were in plans that covered brand-name drugs only or both brand-name and authorized generic drugs; approximately 3% were in plans that covered authorized generic drugs only. Observed authorized generic drug list prices were 67%, 62%, and 50% lower than list prices for Epclusa, Harvoni, and each brand-name insulin product, respectively. Medicare beneficiaries using authorized generic drugs could save $270 per year for 12 vials of Humalog and $2974 for a full course of Harvoni. Plans, however, have limited incentives to encourage authorized generic drug use because rebates for brands likely exceed savings available with authorized generic drugs, particularly for beneficiaries with spending that reaches the Medicare Part D coverage gap. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that authorized generic drugs for insulin and direct-acting antiviral agents may lower out-of-pocket spending for patients but are unlikely to provide savings for Part D plans or Medicare. Instead, these drugs allow manufacturers to offer products at a lower list price without materially lowering net prices or profits."

Current research suggests that TCM can be affected by conventional cardiovascular factors such as hypertension (HTN), diabetes, hyperlipidemia (HLD), and obesity. Despite the increasing interest in this disease, research on TCM remains limited. Conventional cardiovascular factors are clinically related to the outcome of TCM. We reviewed the publications published in PubMed database between January 01 2010 and January 15 2021, and summarized the most current available evidence on the correlation between TCM and the conventional cardiovascular factors. TCM patients are predominantly postmenopausal women. Men and young patients are less commonly seen, but are prone to acute adverse complications and poor prognosis. HTN is common in patients with recurrent TCM. Existing evidence suggests that obesity and chronic kidney disease are related to poor prognosis in TCM. HLD is reported to be associated with fewer complications, though current evidence is limited. Finally, the relationship between diabetes and TCM prognosis is ambivalent. Current evidence suggests conventional cardiovascular risk factors are associated with the outcome of TCM, especially with mortality and complications. More prospective studies are needed to clarify the relationship between each risk factor and the prognosis of TCM."

          "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, is a very interesting syndrome of acute transient left ventricular dysfunction, usually following significant emotional stress. It was first described in Japan nearly two decades ago and many aspects of its pathogenesis still remain poorly understood. The incidence of out-of-hospital sudden death related to Takotsubo is currently unknown. Excess catecholamines following stress seem to trigger Takotsubo and play an important role. The clinical presentation resembles acute myocardial infarction, including chest tightness and/or dyspnea, ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. However, in contrast to a typical acute myocardial infarction, no significant coronary lesions or thrombi are found on coronary angiography. Differentiating Takotsubo from acute myocardial infarction is important to avoid the unnecessary risks of thrombolytic therapy. Typically, left ventriculography shows marked abnormalities with akinesia in the mid-distal anterior wall and apex (occasionally involving other heart regions), giving a balloon shape to the left ventricle. The name Takotsubo originates from the shape of the left ventricle, which resembles a Japanese octopus-trapping pot. Hospital mortality is low but death can be caused by severe acute heart failure and/or ventricular arrhythmias. Typically, a stressful life event is reported preceding the acute symptoms. Takotsubo is most common in menopausal women although young individuals, including men, can also be affected. The autonomic nervous system has a defined role in the process. In this article, we will review the role of imaging the heart using (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine, a radioactive marker allowing mapping of the autonomic nervous system of the heart, in cases of suspected Takotsubo."

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy mimics an acute coronary syndrome and is defined as a transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Diagnosis is based on the criteria of the Mayo Clinic. Stress is found in around 80% of cases: physical stress, emotional stress, medical stress. Physical stress is less found in women. Incidence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is 54.9/1,000,000 inhabitants in women versus only 3.6/1,000,000 inhabitants in men. Diagnosis is based on electrocardiogram, biomarkers, echocardiography, coronary angiography and left ventricular angiography, and cardiac magnetic imaging. The complete recovery of left ventricular systolic function must be assessed, allowing to confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy."

This is accompanied by hypokinesis of the left ventricle and ballooning of the apex, with hypercontractile base and non-obstructive coronary artery disease. Takotsubo was first described in Japan in the early 1990's. It was named such due to the morphology of the apical ballooning that is similar in shape to a 'takotsubo', which is a pot with a round bottom and narrow neck used for trapping octopuses. Though most often described in Asians, reports of Takotsubo in Caucasian populations is becoming more common, possibly due to heightened awareness and detection. The most common presenting symptom of Takotsubo is acute chest pain mimicking myocardial infarction. Patients may also present with dyspnea, pulmonary edema and, more rarely, cardiogenic shock. Clinical symptoms are accompanied by transient left ventricular dysfunction. Despite clinical symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction, normal coronary arteries are usually detected upon cardiac catheterization. The case presented here is of an Asian woman who developed symptoms of acute myocardial infarction during a stressful hospital stay."

          "abstract": "Radiomics is a method to extract detailed information from diagnostic images that cannot be perceived by the naked eye. Although radiomics research carries great potential to improve clinical decision-making, its inherent methodological complexities make it difficult to comprehend every step of the analysis, often causing reproducibility and generalizability issues that hinder clinical adoption. Critical steps in the radiomics analysis and model development pipeline-such as image, application of image filters, and selection of feature extraction parameters-can greatly affect the values of radiomic features. Moreover, common errors in data partitioning, model comparison, fine-tuning, assessment, and calibration can reduce reproducibility and impede clinical translation. Clinical adoption of radiomics also requires a deep understanding of model explainability and the development of intuitive interpretations of radiomic features. To address these challenges, it is essential for radiomics model developers and clinicians to be well-versed in current best practices. Proper knowledge and application of these practices is crucial for accurate radiomics feature extraction, robust model development, and thorough assessment, ultimately increasing reproducibility, generalizability, and the likelihood of successful clinical translation. In this article, we have provided researchers with our recommendations along with practical examples to facilitate good research practices in radiomics. KEY POINTS: Radiomics' inherent methodological complexity should be understood to ensure rigorous radiomic model development to improve clinical decision-making. Adherence to radiomics-specific checklists and quality assessment tools ensures methodological rigor. Use of standardized radiomics tools and best practices enhances clinical translation of radiomics models."

Despite a wealth of exploratory analysis performed on scans acquired from patients with lung cancer and existing guidelines describing some of the key steps, no radiomic-based biomarker has been widely accepted. This is primarily due to limitations with methodology, data analysis, and interpretation of the available studies. There is currently a lack of guidance relating to the entire radiomic workflow from study design to critical appraisal. This guide, written with early career lung cancer researchers, describes a more complete radiomic workflow. Lung cancer image analysis is the focus due to some of the unique challenges encountered such as patient movement from breathing. The guide will focus on CT imaging as these are the most common scans performed on patients with lung cancer. The aim of this article is to support the production of high-quality research that has the potential to positively impact outcome of patients with lung cancer."

Mainly, the application of Radiomics to medical images requires the definition and delimitation of the Region Of Interest (ROI) on the medical image to extract radiomic features. The aim of this preliminary study is to define an approach that automatically detects the specific areas indicative of a particular disease and examines them to minimize diagnostic errors associated with false positives and false negatives. This approach aims to create a nxn grid on the DICOM image sequence and each cell in the matrix is associated with a region from which radiomic features can be extracted. The proposed procedure uses the Model Checking technique and produces as output the medical diagnosis of the patient, i.e., whether the patient under analysis is affected or not by a specific disease. Furthermore, the matrix-based method also localizes where appears the disease marks. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology, a case study on COVID-19 disease is used. Both results on disease identification and localization seem very promising. Furthermore, this proposed approach yields better results compared to methods based on the extraction of features using the whole image as a single ROI, as evidenced by improvements in Accuracy and especially Recall. Our approach supports the advancement of knowledge, interoperability and trust in the software tool, fostering collaboration among doctors, staff and Radiomics."

The objective of the present systematic review was to assess the quality of existing studies that use radiomics methods to predict functional outcomes in patients after acute ischemic stroke. Studies using radiomics-extracted features to predict functional outcomes among patients with acute ischemic stroke using the modified Rankin Scale were included. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase were screened using the terms \"radiomics\" and \"texture\" in combination with \"stroke.\" Quality scores were calculated based on Radiomics Quality Score, the IBSI (Image Biomarkers Standardization Initiative), and the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2). Fourteen studies were included. The median total Radiomics Quality Score was 14.5 (13-16) out of 36. Domains 1, 5, and 6 on protocol quality and stability of imaging and segmentation, level of evidence, and use of open science and data, respectively, were poor. Median IBSI score was 2.5 (1-5) out of 6. Few studies included bias-field correction algorithms, isovoxel resampling, skull stripping, or gray-level discretization. Of 14 studies, none received +6 points, 1 received +5 points, 5 received +4 points, 1 study received +3 points, 5 received +2 points, 2 received +1 points, and none received 0 points. As per the QUADAS-2, 6/14 (42.9%) studies had a risk of bias concern and 0/14 (0%) had applicability concern. The quality of the included studies was low to moderate. With increasing use of radiomics, future studies should attempt to adhere to and report established radiomics quality guidelines."

It is estimated that two to eight percent of the world population is affected by fibromyalgia. From a medical point of view, this pathology still presents inexplicable aspects. It is known that fibromyalgia is caused by a central sensitization phenomenon characterized by the dysfunction of neuro-circuits, which involves the perception, transmission and processing of afferent nociceptive stimuli, with the prevalent manifestation of pain at the level of the locomotor system. In recent years, the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia has also been linked to other factors, such as inflammatory, immune, endocrine, genetic and psychosocial factors. A rheumatologist typically makes a diagnosis of fibromyalgia when the patient describes a history of pain spreading in all quadrants of the body for at least three months and when pain is caused by digital pressure in at least 11 out of 18 allogenic points, called tender points. Fibromyalgia does not involve organic damage, and several diagnostic approaches have been developed in recent years, including the analysis of genetic, epigenetic and serological biomarkers. Symptoms often begin after physical or emotional trauma, but in many cases, there appears to be no obvious trigger. Women are more prone to developing the disease than men. Unfortunately, the conventional medical therapies that target this pathology produce limited benefits. They remain largely pharmacological in nature and tend to treat the symptomatic aspects of various disorders reported by the patient. The statistics, however, highlight the fact that 90% of people with fibromyalgia also turn to complementary medicine to manage their symptoms."

Besides regular physical exercise and calcium rich diet, calcium supplementation can be suggested to both genders, after seventy years as well as systematic vitamin D supplementation in order to cope with the frequent lack observed in our country. Hormone replacement therapy is the first choice in prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Based on a careful evaluation of the needs of a postmenopausal woman as well as on the risk/benefit ratio derived from her individual risk factors, selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene) or second generation bisphosphonates (alendronate) can be considered as alternative to estrogens. Due to its prohibitive cost, nasal calcitonin should be only considered for very specific cases. In osteoporosis confirmed by bone densitometry or by occurrence of fractures, bisphosphonate (alendronate) reduces subsequent fracture rate. Fluoride salts can, in some cases, improve spinal symptomatic osteoporosis.

Currently available guidelines recommend lifestyle counseling and pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis prevention and treatment in postmenopausal women. We analyzed 2 years of National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data (1997-1998), a national representative survey evaluating recent national patterns of antiosteoporosis medication (AOM) use and lifestyle counseling among office visits made by nonpregnant women 40 years and older. Women 40 years and older made an estimated 267 million office visits annually. Of those visits, about 10% were associated with AOM therapy. Estrogen replacement therapy was the most prevalent form of AOM therapy (80%) followed by therapy with calcium and/or cholecalciferol (vitamin D) supplements (15%). Visits for AOM were more likely to be associated with women in their 50s and 60s, white race, and having private insurance or Medicare. Women at AOM visits were twice as likely to receive concurrent lifestyle counseling than women at visits without AOM therapy. Women are particularly at risk for osteoporosis as they experience menopause, with estimates of 20 million women with osteoporosis or osteopenia. Despite the high prevalence, our study showed that only 10% of all visits were associated with 1 or more AOM therapy prescribed, provided, or continued in 1997 and 1998. These data also suggest that women with Medicaid or self-pay status were less likely to receive AOMs than women with other forms of insurance. The status of AOM therapy and lifestyle counseling in ambulatory care practice in the United States during 1997 and 1998 was less than optimal."

The risk of osteoporosis and/or fragility fractures can be reduced through healthy lifestyle changes. These include adequate dietary intakes of calcium, vitamin D and protein, regular weight-bearing exercise, reduction in alcohol intake and smoking cessation. European guidance for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women recommends a daily intake of at least 1000 mg/day for calcium, 800 IU/day for vitamin D and 1 g/kg body weight of protein for all women aged over 50 years. The development of programs that encourage lifestyle changes (in particular balanced nutrient intakes) are therefore essential for the reduction of osteoporosis risk."

Postmenopausal women are at risk for osteoporosis and fractures. Weight-bearing and resistance exercise, limiting alcohol and caffeine intake, smoking cessation, and fall prevention strategies are part of a bone-healthy lifestyle used to manage postmenopausal osteoporosis. Supplements containing calcium and vitamin D are needed by many postmenopausal women because of an inadequate intake and other factors. The choice of osteoporosis drug therapy should take into consideration patient characteristics and preference and drug efficacy, safety, route of administration, dosing frequency, convenience, cost, and potential for nonadherence. Bisphosphonates generally are preferred for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, with raloxifene, teriparatide, and calcitonin salmon as alternatives. Denosumab, a fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin G(2) antibody, may become available soon for prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Health-system pharmacists can improve the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women by counseling them on a bone-healthy lifestyle and making recommendations for calcium and vitamin D supplements and osteoporosis medications to prevent or treat the disease. A variety of approaches are available to promote bone health in postmenopausal women. Health-system pharmacists can promote interventions to optimize patient outcomes."

          "abstract": "On the basis of currently available information, the following recommendations can be made for treating osteoporosis. Women with no contraindications should maintain a total calcium intake of 1,000 mg daily before menopause and 1,500 mg daily after menopause. Calcium supplementation should be considered adjunct treatment in postmenopausal women and those who already have osteoporosis. At menopause, women with no contraindications should be given the option of taking estrogen to prevent osteoporosis. Vitamin D supplementation up to the recommended dietary allowance should be used in patients who may not get adequate dietary intake or sunlight exposure. Calcium carbonate should be the main calcium supplement when possible, because it is usually the least expensive and has the highest percentage of calcium. In older patients, who may have achlorhydria, calcium carbonate should be taken with food or another form of calcium that is well absorbed should be used. In compliant patients, calcium supplements should be given in two or three divided doses. Until more is known about exercise and osteoporosis, low-intensity exercise that promotes cardiovascular fitness should be prescribed. One appropriate regimen is brisk walking for 1 hour three times a week."

However, following the publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and the Million Women Study (MWS), regulatory authorities issued an urgent safety restriction on HRT use in preventing post-menopausal osteoporosis, recommending that it now be considered a second-line treatment. Are such recommendations justified? Treatments for osteoporosis, in women with increased future risk for fractures but who have not yet developed the disease, should prevent all types of osteoporotic fractures. Of the available therapies, none other than HRT has been clearly demonstrated to prevent hip fractures in such women. Thus, HRT should be recommended as first-line treatment for osteoporosis prevention. Potential risks of HRT, such as increased development of breast cancer and increased thromboembolism, have long been known. The WHI showed risks in less than 0.3% of women studied, and the MWS appears to have overestimated the risk of breast cancer. Thus, no new safety issues have been identified, and the regulatory authorities may have misinterpreted the data from these recent studies. When given for the correct indications, HRT is of major benefit to many women."

We discuss the mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate pro- and anti-inflammatory aspects of T-cell responses within the CNS. Depending on the microenvironment, they may become potent antigen-presenting cells for T cells and they may contribute to inflammatory processes. They are also able to abrogate or reprogram T-cell responses by inducing apoptosis or secreting inhibitory mediators.

They have many important functions in the central nervous system (CNS), including the maintenance of glutamate and ion homeostasis, the elimination of oxidative stress, energy storage in glycogen, tissue repair, regulating synaptic activity by releasing neurotransmitters, and participating in synaptic formation. Astrocytes have special highly ramified structure. Their branches contact with synapses of neurons inwardly, with fine structure and wrapping synapses; their feet contact with blood vessels of brain parenchyma outward, almost wrapping the whole brain. The adjacent astrocytes rarely overlap and communicate with each other through gap junction channels. The ideal location of astrocytes enables them to sense the weak changes of their surroundings and provide the structural basis for the energy supply of neurons. Neurons and astrocytes are closely coupled units of energy metabolism in the brain. Neurons consume a lot of ATPs in the process of neurotransmission. Astrocytes provide metabolic substrates for neurons, maintain high activity of neuron, and facilitate information transmission of neurons. This article reviews the characteristics of glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of astrocytes. The metabolic interactions between astrocytes and neurons, astrocytes and microglia were also detailed discussed. Finally, we classified analyzed the role of metabolic disorder of astrocytes in the occurrence and development of neurodegenerative diseases."

Changes in the strength of synaptic connections are indeed thought to be the cellular basis of learning and memory. Importantly, astrocytes have been demonstrated to tightly regulate these processes via the release of several gliotransmitters linked to astrocytic calcium activity as well as astrocyte-neuron metabolic coupling. Therefore, astrocytes seem to be integrators of and actors upon learning- and memory-relevant information. In this review, we focus on the role of astrocytes in learning and memory processes. We delineate the recognized inputs and outputs of astrocytes and explore the influence of manipulating astrocytes on behaviour across diverse learning paradigms. We conclude that astrocytes influence learning and memory in various manners. Appropriate astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics are being increasingly identified as central contributors to memory formation and retrieval. In addition, astrocytes regulate brain rhythms essential for cognition, and astrocyte-neuron metabolic cooperation is required for memory consolidation."

Astrocytes respond to CNS insults through reactive astrogliosis, in which they go through many functional and molecular changes. In neuroinflammatory conditions reactive astrocytes exert both beneficial and detrimental functions, depending on the context and heterogeneity of astrocytic populations. In this review we profile astrocytic diversity in the context of neuroinflammation; with a specific focus on multiple sclerosis (MS) and its best-described animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We characterize two main subtypes, protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes and describe the role of intermediate filaments in the physiology and pathology of these cells.

During the past two decades, astrocytes emerged also as increasingly important regulators of neuronal functions including the generation of new nerve cells and structural as well as functional synapse remodeling. Reactive gliosis or reactive astrogliosis is a term coined for the morphological and functional changes seen in astroglial cells/astrocytes responding to CNS injury and other neurological diseases. Whereas this defensive reaction of astrocytes is conceivably aimed at handling the acute stress, limiting tissue damage, and restoring homeostasis, it may also inhibit adaptive neural plasticity mechanisms underlying recovery of function. Understanding the multifaceted roles of astrocytes in the healthy and diseased CNS will undoubtedly contribute to the development of treatment strategies that will, in a context-dependent manner and at appropriate time points, modulate reactive astrogliosis to promote brain repair and reduce the neurological impairment."

One potential reason for the obscurity of astrocytic function is that they represent a diverse population of cells that all share some critical characteristics. In the CNS, astrocytes have been proposed to perform many functions. For example, they are supportive cells that provide guidance to newly formed migrating neurons and axons. They regulate the functions of endothelial cells at the blood brain barrier, provide nutrients, and maintain homeostasis including ionic balance within the CNS. More recently, dissecting the central role of astrocytes in mediating injury responses in the CNS, particularly the spinal cord, has become an area of considerable importance. The ability to culture-enriched populations of astrocytes has facilitated a detailed dissection of their potential roles in the developing and adult, normal, and injured brain and spinal cord. Most importantly, in vitro models have defined molecular signals that may mediate or regulate astrocyte functions and the capacity to modulate these signals may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention after spinal cord injury and other neural insults."

At the JSC \"European Medical Center\" in the period from 2022 to 2024 we performed laparoscopic radical orchiectomies in three patients with testicular cancer. All patients were examined on an outpatient basis, ultrasound and MRI of the scrotum, PET-CT scan were performed, and laboratory tests were carried out. Malignant testicular lesion was confirmed in all patients. All operations were performed in full volume, without complications during the operation and in the postoperative period. The duration of the laparoscopic surgery was comparable to the standard open technique. In the postoperative period the pain intensity in the area of surgery, the recovery period and the presence of complications were evaluated. CONCLUSION: Radical orchiectomy with laparoscopic assistance is a minimally invasive method of surgical treatment of testicular tumors, which allows to perform the removal of the testis and elements of the spermatic cord as radically and safely as possible, and also has pronounced advantages in the form of reduction of postoperative pain syndrome in the area of surgery (no more than 2 points on VAS), reduction of the recovery period and the risk of possible postoperative complications."

A retrospective review of 29 patients undergoing laparoscopic RPLND was performed. All patients had clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumor, with vascular invasion and/or embryonal carcinoma in the orchiectomy specimen. A modified template dissection was performed. Patients with retroperitoneal metastases were offered two cycles of chemotherapy. A modified follow-up schedule was used in patients with pathologically negative nodes. Lymph nodes were negative in 17 of 29 patients. Of these 17 patients, 15 had no recurrence and were free of disease with 5.8 years of follow-up. Two patients had recurrence, one in the chest, and one biochemically, and both were free of disease after chemotherapy. Twelve of 29 patients had lymph nodes with metastatic testicular cancer. Ten of these patients underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and were free of disease with 6.3 years of follow-up. One patient had a biochemical recurrence after positive RPLND and was salvaged with chemotherapy. One patient was observed after positive RPLND and was free of disease with 4.9 years of follow-up. The only long-term complication was retrograde ejaculation in 1 patient. Laparoscopic RPLND is a safe, minimally invasive treatment option in patients with clinical Stage I nonseminomatous germ cell testicular tumor.

This review was aimed at precisely estimating this association by pooling all available epidemiological studies. 25 independent studies were retrieved after a comprehensive literature search in databases of PubMed and Embase. Overall, common hormonal factors including oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy did not alter the risk of thyroid cancer. Older age at menopause was associated with weakly increased risk of thyroid cancer in overall analysis (RR = 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.53, P = 0.049); however, longer duration of breast feeding was related to moderately reduced risk of thyroid cancer, suggested by pooled analysis in all cohort studies (RR = 0.7, 95% CI 0.51-0.95, P = 0.021). The pooled RR in hospital-based case-control studies implicated that parous women were more susceptible to thyroid cancer than nulliparous women (RR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.31-4.04, P = 0.004). The present meta-analysis suggests that older age at menopause and parity are risk factors for thyroid cancer, while longer duration of breast feeding plays a protective role against this cancer. Nevertheless, more relevant epidemiological studies are warranted to investigate roles of hormonal and reproductive factors in thyroid carcinogenesis."

Their exact role in relation to thyroid regulation has not been fully elucidated but it is clear that many of these peptide regulatory factors are mitogenic for cultured thyrocytes. Recent evidence suggests that some thyroid cancers and benign goiters over-express receptors for a number of these growth factors. Transforming growth factor-beta is unique for its dominant anti-proliferative effect on thyrocytes concurrently exposed to potent thyroid mitogens. The mammalian thyroid cell is clearly a source as well as target of myriad polypeptide factors that probably co-regulate its normal growth and differentiation.

To determine the frequency of carcinoma thyroid among patients presenting with goiter and its association with TSH, Tg/ATg and other demographic factors. A total of 73 adult patients of either gender with solitary solid cold nodules and/or multi-ndoular goiter (MNG) with predominant solid cold nodules were enrolled. All surgically resected samples were sent for histopathology. The frequency of thyroid cancer and its subtypes was noted and tested for association with gender, age (< or ≥40 years), recent increase in swelling size, TSH, Tg and ATg. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 26% (n=19) of the patients, 14 (73.7%) being diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer and 5 (26.3%) with follicular thyroid cancer. No other subtypes were noted. Presence of thyroid cancer was significantly associated with recent increase in swelling size and higher TSH Values mean TSH values (P<0.05). No significant association was found with gender, age, Tg and ATg values (P>0.05). Overall percentage of thyroid cancer in our study sample was found to be 26%, with a predominance of papillary over follicular lesions. Rates were significantly higher in patients who had history of recent increase in swelling size and higher and higher pre-surgery TSH values."

On this purpose, the morphologic factors that correlate the type of thyroid cancer to the host stromal alterations were studied on 3 groups of 20 patients each and 2 control lots for multinodular goiter and nodular goiter. One group consisted of cases of thyroid carcinoma associated with endemic goiter, the second group included cases of thyroid carcinoma with thyroiditis and nodular goiter and the third group, the cases of thyroid sclerosing occult carcinoma. The study showed in all the cases, that thyroid cancer evoluates as an autonomic lesion, independent of the endemic goiter which is not a risk factor."

          "abstract": "While well-differentiated thyroid cancer is generally thought to be a treatable cancer with excellent outcomes, some patients suffer from recurrent disease. Risk factors for recurrent disease include primary disease greater than 4 cm, incomplete resection, multiple positive lymph nodes in the central compartment, and lateral neck disease with multiple positive lymph nodes in multiple levels or pathologic extracapsular extension. These factors can help stratify the thyroid cancer population in to low-, medium-, and high-risk patients. Low-risk patients can generally be followed with thyroglogulin levels and routine ultrasounds to the head and neck. High-risk patients are best monitored with stimulated thyroglobulin, ultrasound of the head and neck, and low-dose iodine 131 uptake scans at the 6- to 12-month mark. The treatment of locoregional recurrent thyroid cancer is surgical resection with the overall goal of complete tumor removal while maintaining function and decreasing risks. The use of adjuvant therapy is dependent on the presence / absence of high risk pathologic features."

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of diagnostic radiation exposure on thyroid cancer risk. The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Summary odds ratio (OR) estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) were used to compute the risk of thyroid cancer using fixed- and random-effects models. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the potential heterogeneity. Nine studies from 12 publications were included in the meta-analysis. Overall exposure to diagnostic radiation exposure was associated with a significantly increased thyroid cancer risk (OR = 1.52 [CI 1.13-2.04]). The subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed similar results. By type of exposure, exposure to computed tomography scans (OR = 1.46 [CI 1.27-1.68]) or dental x-rays (OR = 1.69 [CI 1.17-2.44]) were associated with an increased thyroid cancer risk. Head and neck (OR = 1.31 [CI 1.02-1.69]) and chest (OR = 1.71 [CI 1.09-2.69]) exposure to diagnostic radiation was associated with an increased thyroid cancer risk. The results of this meta-analysis indicate that diagnostic radiation exposure is associated with an increased thyroid cancer risk. Therefore, to the extent that it will not compromise the information being sought, radiation exposure to the thyroid should be minimized during diagnostic examinations."

When surgically removed, the cellular changes of CLT are commonly seen surrounding thyroid cancers. This study investigates the malignancy rate in CLT patients when compared with non-CLT patients after thyroidectomy. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data for 1268 patients with index thyroid nodules who underwent thyroidectomy at a single institution was performed. Patients were excluded if they had previous thyroid surgery, known thyroid cancer, Graves' disease, family history of thyroid cancer, and history of radiation exposure. Patients were subdivided into CLT and non-CLT groups by final pathology. Final pathology was reviewed and grouped into cancer in the index thyroid nodule and incidental thyroid cancers. Chi-squared analyses were performed using SAS. Of 359 patients that met study criteria, 52 had CLT. Overall, the malignancy rate was 37% in both CLT patients (19/52) and non-CLT patients (114/307) (P = 0.86). However, incidental thyroid cancer was found in 15% (8/52) of CLT patients and 10% (31/307) of non-CLT patients (relative risk = 1.52) who had no index nodule cancer. The breakdown of incidental cancer subtype in CLT patients was classic variant papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), n = 3; follicular variant PTC, n = 5. Patients with CLT have a 1.5-fold increased risk of incidental PTC. CLT should be considered a risk factor for incidental thyroid cancer, and patients with this thyroid condition should be counseled and monitored periodically for underlying thyroid malignancy."

          "abstract": "Thyroid cancer represents approximately 1% of all human malignancies. papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common malignant tumor of the thyroid gland, accounting for 70-80% of all thyroid cancers. In the US, the incidence of thyroid cancer is 4 per 100,000 individuals. It is two to four times as frequent in women as in men. The development of PTC is influenced by many factors including genetic alterations, growth factors, and physical agents such as radiation. In order to recognize the prognosis for PTC, a lot of clinic and pathological parameters such as; age, tumor size, extra-thyroid tumor spread, lymph node, distant metastases, gender, tumor stage are used. As most of these parameters are subjective, more objective and useful prognostic factors are needed for determining biologic behavior, providing an initial assessment. In this study, we aimed to compare the expressions of COX-2, E-cadherin, VEGF to classical prognostic factors, and to investigate the correlation with prognosis. Operation records from 79 PTC cases were examined retrospectively. In the study, we aimed to investigate the whole tissue by means of stereology method, which is an impartial one, and we indicated the expression COX-2, VEGF, E-cadherin immunohistochemically in 79 resection diagnosed with PTC. We determined correlations between the expressions of COX-2 and VEGF, E-cadherin, and age, gender, and stage."

          "abstract": "The pathogenesis of thyroid cancer is complex. Iodium deficiency, genetic factors, sex, older age, irradiation in childhood, thyroid growth stimulating antibodies and epithelial growth factor possibly affect its development. Recent reports, also epidemiological, have shown that differentiated thyroid cancer (papillary, follicular, oxyphillic) is dependent on sex hormones, especially estrogens. This has prompted research into the presence of estrogens and progesterone, as well as androgen receptors (ER, PR and AR) in normal and neoplastic thyreocytes and estradiol content in thyroid tissue. The results of these investigations imply that thyroid cancers are estrogen-dependent. There is, however, no agreement in reports about correlation between tumor malignancy and ER, PR and AR expression. In this study 72 thyroid glands have been examined using immunohistochemical assays with ERs and PRs antibodies. Positive staining was demonstrated mainly in differentiated thyroid cancer nuclei (17 ERs positive and 2 PRs positive). There was no expression of antibodies in non-neoplastic cells or in adjacent tissues. The nuclei of 3 oxyphillic and 4 follicular adenomas were also ERs positive. On the other hand nuclei of 5 follicular adenomas were PRs positive. These results are in agreement with most available data. It seems, however, that the material so far examined by the investigators is too small. Furthermore, because of using various methods the results cannot be compared. Further studies are necessary to reveal if there is any true influence of sex hormones on the development of thyroid lesions and if the detection of sex hormone receptors may help in choosing adequate therapy."

Important advances have been made in deciphering the microenvironment of GBMs, but its association with existing molecular subtypes and its potential prognostic role remain elusive. We have investigated the abundance of infiltrating immune and stromal cells in silico, from gene expression profiles. Two cohorts, including in-house normal brain and glioma samples (n = 70) and a large sample set from TCGA (n = 393), were combined into a single exploratory dataset. A third independent cohort (n = 124) was used for validation. Tumors were clustered based on their microenvironment infiltration profiles, and associations with known GBM molecular subtypes and patient outcome were tested a posteriori in a multivariable setting. We identified a subset of GBM samples with significantly higher abundances of most immune and stromal cell populations. This subset showed increased expression of both immune suppressor and immune effector genes compared to other GBMs and was enriched for the mesenchymal molecular subtype. Survival analyses suggested that tumor microenvironment infiltration pattern was an independent prognostic factor for GBM patients. Among all, patients with the mesenchymal subtype with low immune and stromal infiltration had the poorest survival. By combining molecular subtyping with gene expression measures of tumor infiltration, the present work contributes with improving prognostic models in GBM."

We aimed to determine the immunological characteristics of CD3 T-cells, Vδ1 T-cells, and microglia/macrophages infiltrating brain gliomas. We collected 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples issued from 19 cases of GBM and 5 cases of LGG. An immunohistochemical analysis was performed using anti-CD3, anti-Vδ1, and anti-iba-1 antibodies. Labelling indexes (LI) of CD3 and Vδ1 were evaluated quantitatively, and other CD3, Vδ1, and iba-1 staining characteristics were evaluated qualitatively. The median age of patients was 49 years in GBM and 52 years in LGG. The sex ratio was 1.4 and GBM predominated in males (p = 0.05). In GBM, the medians of CD3-LI and Vδ1-LI were 30 and 3.5 respectively. CD3-LI inversely correlated with survival in GBM cases (r =  - 0.543; p = 0.016). CD3 staining intensity correlated with CD3-LI (p < 0.0001) and with the survival in GBM cases (p = 0.003). Compared to LGG, the CD3-LI, the intensity of intra-tumoral Vδ1 staining, and the amount of iba-1 were higher in GBM (p = 0.042; p = 0.014; and p = 0.001 respectively). The iba-1 organization was more amoeboid in older patients and more branched in younger patients (p = 0.028) and tended to be more amoeboid in cases with high iba-1 amount (p = 0.09). Our results suggest that a high level of CD3-LI and a strong intra-tumoral infiltration of Vδ1 T-cells as well as a high involvement of TAM can be considered potential markers of poor prognosis of GBM. However, this requires further studies on more balanced GBM-LGG sample, including an expanded panel of biomarkers."

Clinical information was obtained from electronic medical records. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the survival function of pre-treatment NLR and PLR in these glioblastoma patients. Neutrophil and CD3(+) T-cell infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarray cores from glioblastomas. Pre-treatment NLR levels were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) in glioblastoma patients (multivariate hazard ratio =1.050; 95% confidence interval, 1.003-1.100; P = 0.037). Despite the correlation between NLR and PLR (R = 0.509, P < 0.001), NLR was superior to PLR as a prognostic factor. High pre-treatment NLR (≥4 versus < 4) was significantly associated with high neutrophil infiltration and low CD3(+) T-cell infiltration into tumors, and predicted poor OS (mean, 10.6 vs. 17.9 months, P < 0.001). Pre-treatment NLR is of prognostic significance independent of MGMT status and is superior to PLR as a prognostic factor. Our results demonstrate a correlation between elevated peripheral blood NLR levels and increased tumor neutrophil infiltration/decreased CD3(+) T-cell infiltration."

Although immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as programmed cell death protein (PD)-1/PD ligand-1 inhibitors, has revolutionized the treatment of several cancers, the clinical benefit in GBM patients has been limited. Lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) binding to human leukocyte antigen-II (HLA-II) plays an essential role in triggering CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion and could interfere with the efficiency of anti-PD-1 treatment; however, the value of LAG-3-HLA-II interactions in ICI immunotherapy for GBM patients has not yet been analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the expression and regulation of HLA-II in human GBM samples and the correlation with LAG-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration. Human leukocyte antigen-II was highly expressed in GBM and correlated with increased LAG-3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in the stroma. Additionally, HLA-II<sup>High</sup>LAG-3<sup>High</sup> was associated with worse patient survival. Increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression was observed in GBM, which was correlated with high levels of HLA-II and LAG-3<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in stroma.

          "abstract": "Although most tracheal intubations with direct laryngoscopy are not performed with a styletted endotracheal tube, it is recommended that a stylet can be used with indirect videolaryngoscopy. Recently, there were several reports of complications associated with styletted endotracheal tubes and videolaryngoscopy. In this study, we compared three videolaryngoscopes (VLSs) in patients undergoing tracheal intubation for elective surgery: the GlideScope Ranger (GlideScope, Bothell, WA), the V-MAC Storz Berci DCI (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany), and the McGrath (McGrath series 5, Aircraft medical, Edinburgh, UK) and tested whether it is feasible to intubate the trachea of patients with indirect videolaryngoscopy without using a stylet. Four hundred fifty consecutive adults (ASA PS I-II) undergoing tracheal intubation for elective surgery were randomly allocated for airway management with one of the three devices. Anesthesia induction for tracheal intubation consisted of fentanyl-propofol-rocuronium. An independent anesthesiologist used the Cormack-Lehane grading system to score an initial direct laryngoscopic view using a classic metal Macintosh blade. After subsequent positive-pressure ventilation using a face mask and an oxygen-sevoflurane mixture for 1 min, the trachea was intubated using one of the three VLSs. During intubation, the following data were collected: intubation time, number of intubation attempts, use of extra tools to facilitate intubation, and overall satisfaction score of the intubation conditions. The trachea of every patient was intubated using the VLSs, and none of the patients required conversion to the classic Macintosh laryngoscope. All three VLSs offered equal or better view of the glottis as assessed by the mean Cormack-Lehane grade, compared with the traditional Macintosh laryngoscopy, including a larger viewing angle of the glottic entrance. The average intubation time was 34 +/- 20 s for the GlideScope, 18 +/- 12 s for the V-MAC Storz, and 38 +/- 23 s for the McGrath VLS. Intubation with the Storz was faster (P < 0.05) than the other two VLS tested and necessitated fewer additional tools (P < 0.01), resulting in a higher first-pass successful intubation rate. A stylet had to be used in 7% of the patients in the Storz group versus about 50% of the patients when the other two VLS were used. The trachea of a large proportion of patients with normal airways can be intubated successfully with certain VLS blades without using a stylet, although the three studied VLSs clearly differ in outcome. The Storz VLS displaces soft tissues in the fashion of a classic Macintosh scope, affording room for tracheal tube insertion and limiting the need for stylet use compared with the other two scopes. Although VLSs offer several advantages, including better visualization of the glottic entrance and intubation conditions, a good laryngeal view does not guarantee easy or successful tracheal tube insertion. We recommend that the geometry of VLSs, including blade design, should be studied in more detail."

In a secondary observational analysis of data from 2 multicenter, randomized trials that enrolled critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation but did not control for laryngoscope type (video laryngoscope vs direct laryngoscope), we fit mixed-effects logistic regression models examining the 1) the association between laryngoscope type (video laryngoscope vs direct laryngoscope) and the Cormack-Lehane grade of view and 2) the interaction between grade of view, laryngoscope type (video laryngoscope vs direct laryngoscope), and the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt. We analyzed 1,786 patients: 467 (26.2%) in the direct laryngoscope group and 1,319 (73.9%) in the video laryngoscope group. The use of a video laryngoscope was associated with an improved grade of view as compared with a direct laryngoscope (adjusted odds ratio for increasingly favorable grade of view 3.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.47 to 3.99). Successful intubation on the first attempt occurred in 83.2% of patients in the video laryngoscope group and 72.2% of patients in the direct laryngoscope group (absolute difference 11.1%, 95% CI 6.5% to 15.6%). Video laryngoscope use modified the association between grade of view and successful intubation on the first attempt such that intubation on the first attempt was similar between video laryngoscope and direct laryngoscope at a grade 1 view and higher for video laryngoscope than direct laryngoscope at grade 2 to 4 views (P<.001 for interaction term). Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, the use of a video laryngoscope was associated both with a better view of the vocal cords and with a higher probability of successfully intubating the trachea when the view of the vocal cords was incomplete in this observational analysis. However, a multicenter, randomized trial directly comparing the effect of a video laryngoscope with a direct laryngoscope on the grade of view, success, and complications is needed."

          "abstract": "The incidence of difficult and failed intubation is higher in obstetrical patients than in the general population because of anatomic and physiologic changes in pregnancy. Videolaryngoscopy improves the success rate of intubation and reduces complications when compared with direct laryngoscopy in adults; however, it is not known whether this extends to obstetrical surgery. The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy, efficiency, and safety of videolaryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy in obstetrics. Central, CINAHL, Embase, MEDLINE and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 27 May 2020 with no restrictions. Inclusion criteria included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, case series, and case reports that reported the application of videolaryngoscopy to intubate the trachea in pregnant patients having general anesthesia. Overall, four RCTs with 428 participants, nine observational studies, and 35 case reports/series with 100 participants were included. On meta-analysis of three trials, the co-primary outcomes of first-attempt success rate (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.98 to 1.06; P = 0.29; I2 = 0%) and time to tracheal intubation (mean difference, 1.20 sec; 95% CI, -6.63 to 9.04; P = 0.76; I<sup>2</sup> = 95%) demonstrated no difference between videolaryngoscopy and direct laryngoscopy in parturients without difficult airways. Observational studies and case reports underline the role of videolaryngoscopy as a primary choice when difficulty with tracheal intubation is expected or as a rescue modality in difficult or failed intubations. Evidence for the utility of videolaryngoscopy continues to evolve but supports its increased adoption in obstetrics where videolaryngoscopes should be immediately available for use as a first-line device.

Using the technique of video laryngoscopy, the alignment of the oral and pharyngeal axes to facilitate tracheal intubation is unnecessary. In this study we evaluated the McGrath Series 5 videolaryngoscope for tracheal intubation in 61 patients who exhibited Cormack and Lehane grade 3 or 4 laryngoscopies with a Macintosh laryngoscope. Using the McGrath resulted in an improved glottic view, compared to Macintosh laryngoscope. Laryngoscopy was improved by one grade in 10%, by two grades in 80% and by three grades in 10% of cases (p < 0.0001). The success rate for intubation was 95% with the McGrath. These results suggest that the McGrath videolaryngoscope can be used with a high success rate to facilitate tracheal intubation in difficult intubation situations."

One hundred and twenty adult patients undergoing elective minor surgery requiring general anaesthesia and endotracheal intubation presenting with at least one predictor for a difficult airway were enrolled after Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent was obtained. Repeated laryngoscopy was performed using direct laryngoscope, DCI laryngoscope and GlideScope in a randomized sequence before patients were intubated. Both video laryngoscopes showed significantly better laryngoscopic view (according to Cormack and Lehane classification as modified by Yentis and Lee = C&L) than direct laryngoscope. Laryngoscopic view C&L >or= III was measured in 30% of patients when using direct laryngoscopy, and in only 11% when using the DCI laryngoscope (P < 0.001). The GlideScope enabled significantly better laryngoscopic view (C&L >or= III: 1.6%) than both direct (P < 0.001) and DCI laryngoscopes (P < 0.05). Clinically relevant improvement in the specific 36 patients with insufficient direct view (C&L >or= III) could be achieved significantly more often with the GlideScope (94.4%) than with the DCI laryngoscope (63.8%; P < 0.01). Laryngoscopy time did not differ between instruments [median (range): direct laryngoscope, 13 (5-33) s; DCI laryngoscope, 14 (6-40) s; GlideScope, 13 (5-34) s]. In contrast, tracheal intubation needed significantly more time with both video laryngoscopes [DCI laryngoscope, 27 (17-94) s, P < 0.05 and GlideScope, 33 (18-68) s, P < 0.01] than with the direct laryngoscope [22.5 (12-49) s]. Intubation failed in four cases (10%) using the direct laryngoscope and in one case (2.5%) each using the DCI laryngoscope and the GlideScope.

The main aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of McGrath®MAC blade 1 in comparison with a conventional Macintosh laryngoscope blade 1, in children aged less than 24 months. Thirty-eight children aged less than 24 months were randomly allocated to one of two groups, and tracheal intubation was attempted using either a direct laryngoscope with a Macintosh blade 1 or a videolaryngoscope with a McGRATH®MAC blade 1. In another 12 children aged 2-4 years, the same comparisons were made with blade 2. The primary outcome measure was time to tracheal intubation using a size 1 blade. Tracheal intubation took significantly longer with a McGRATH®MAC blade 1 (median (interquartile range): 38.0 (31.8-43.5) s) than with the Macintosh blade 1(27.4 (25.9-29.2) s) (p < 0.0001; median difference (95% CI for the median difference): 10.6 (6.4-14.0) s), mainly due to difficulty in advancing a tube into the trachea.

A prospective observational study of 1,654 patients undergoing general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation over a seven-month period was performed. Data regarding airway and anaesthetic management was collected and analysed. Videolaryngoscopes were used as the first-choice equipment in 60.5% of the cohort. The incidence of difficult intubation was 2.1%, of which 45.7% of cases were unanticipated. The sensitivity of airway assessment was 54.3%, with a positive predictive value of 8.1%. When difficult intubation was anticipated, more videolaryngoscopes were used as the first equipment of choice compared to the Macintosh laryngoscope (p < 0.001). In the Macintosh group, more patients required a change of airway equipment (p = 0.015), but the number of intubation attempts was similar (p = 0.293). The incidence of intraoperative (p = 0.920) and postoperative complications (p = 0.380) were similar in both groups.

          "abstract": "To evaluate, whether the video-optical intubation stylet (VOIS) was more successful for difficult tracheal intubation than the Bullard laryngoscope (BL). An intubation mannequin head was modified so that, using a Macintosh blade size 3, only the epiglottis was visible at direct laryngoscopy, representing a grade III laryngoscopic view. Forty anesthesiologists attempted tracheal intubation using each technique. Tracheal intubation with the Bullard laryngoscope was performed using the attached non-malleable intubating stylet preloaded with an endotracheal tube. The video-optical intubation stylet inserted into an endotracheal tube was used with direct laryngoscopy. During conventional laryngoscopy, the video-view from the stylet tip allowed the tracheal tube to be guided behind the epiglottis into the trachea. Ten attempts with each technique were performed by each anesthesiologist in randomized order. Intubation time, and failed intubation (> 60 sec/esophageal intubation) were recorded. The operators assessed the degree of difficulty of each method using a Likert-scale. Mean intubation time (19.2+/-4.5 sec for the BL and 18.8+/-4.6 sec for the VOIS) was almost the identical. The video-optical intubation stylet was associated with fewer failed intubations (8 vs. 41; P<0.005) and had a lower degree of difficulty (1.7+/-0.65 for the VOIS and 2.6+/-0.74 for the BL; P<0.0001). No correlation was found between the anesthesiologist's experience and mean intubation time, estimated degree of difficulty or number of unsuccessful intubation. The video-optical intubation stylet was a more effective and simpler intubation device to facilitate difficult tracheal intubation than the Bullard laryngoscope."

In 50 pediatric patients (mean age 12.8 +/- 3.1 yr, range 6-16 yr) a grade 3 direct laryngoscopic view was simulated. Eight certified registered nurse anesthetists without experience in endoscopic intubation performed tracheal intubation on five or more patients using the video-optical intubation stylet. Time from insertion of the tube into the oral cavity until the tip had passed the vocal cords was recorded. Failed intubation was defined as intubation >60 sec, arterial oxygen saturation <92% or esophageal intubation. Subjective degree of difficulty was asked from the operators using a Likert-scale. Forty-six of the 50 patients were successfully intubated within 60 sec and without arterial oxygen desaturation. In four patients, video-assisted tracheal intubation failed due to prolonged intubation time. Intubation times ranged from 10-40 sec (median 15 sec). Mean intubation time in the first patient (24.5 +/- 17.3 sec) appeared longer than for the fifth patient (20.8 +/- 10.9 sec), but the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.87). Mean estimated degree of difficulty was 3.9 +/- 2.1. Subjective estimates of difficulty increased with intubation times (P=0.001). The video-optical intubation stylet can be considered a valuable aid for tracheal intubation in pediatric patients with a difficult airway."

Her brain CT revealed massive brain lesions. After ECT, she became dramatically more cooperative, less aggressive and ate food and took her medication. In addition, no spontaneous seizure was noted after ECT. However, when we stopped ECT, the previous symptoms gradually reappeared.

          "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders which indicate the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) also occur in epileptic patients, but there is a lack of medical authority concerning the use of ECT in epileptic patients. This is surprising because in recent years it has been proved that ECT has an anti-convulsive effect to some degree. A case study of an epileptic patient is presented whose progress has been monitored for several years. Antiepileptic drugs were seemingly able to control his epilepsy but at the same time progressive behavioural disturbance (schizophreniform psychosis) accompanied by agitation and violent behaviour developed. Considering the recurrent psychotic decompensations and the relative ineffectiveness of antipsychotics, the authors decided to administer ECT. As a result they were able to bring about the longest symptom free balanced period in the patient. According to the data based on previous medical studies and the experience they can suppose that ECT is not immediately contraindicated by the presence of epilepsy with active interictal focus if the psychopathological condition makes it necessary. In view of the epileptogenic risk factors of classical neuroleptics, the epileptogenic effects of accompanying psychosis and the probable anticonvulsive potential of ECT in cases of severe psychiatric complications accompanying epilepsy ECT could be used more frequently."

All 169,457 patients with first hospital contact for an affective disorder between January 2005 and December 2015 were identified in the Danish National Patient Registry and followed for incident epilepsy from January 2005 until November 2016. The association between ECT and epilepsy was examined using Cox proportional hazard regression with adjustment for gender, age, educational level, comorbid schizophrenia, previous stroke and antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use. A total of 5875 patients had at least one ECT and 1873 patients developed epilepsy (Incidence rate: 213 pr. 100,000 person years) during the follow-up of mean 5 years.

In the polarization process of macrophages, the classic molecular mechanism is related to sequential transcription factors. Whether in tumor or inflammatory local microenvironment, the pathological factors of the local microenvironment often affect the polarization of M1 and M2 macrophages, and participate in the occurrence and development of these pathological processes. In recent years, a growing number of research results demonstrated that non‑coding RNA (ncRNA) also participates in the polarization process of macrophages, in addition to traditional cytokines and transcriptional regulation signal pathway molecules. Among numerous ncRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) have attracted more attention from scholars both domestically and internationally, and significant progress has been made in basic and clinical research. Therefore, for improved understanding of the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in macrophage polarization and analysis of the potential value of this regulatory pathway in tumor and inflammatory intervention therapy, a comprehensive review of the progress of relevant literature research was conducted and some viewpoints and perspectives were proposed."

Here, we discovered the different macrophages' impacts on lung cancer cell A549. The M2a/M2c subtypes promoted A549 invasion and xenograft tumor growth. The M1 subtype suppressed angiogenesis. M1 enhanced the sensitivity of A549 to cisplatin and decreased the tube formation activity and cell viability of A549 cells by inducing apoptosis and senescence. Different macrophage subtypes regulated genes involved in the immune response, cytoskeletal remodeling, coagulation, cell adhesion, and apoptosis pathways in A549 cells, which was a pattern that correlated with the altered behaviors of the A549 cells. Furthermore, we found that the identified M1/M2 gene signatures were significantly correlated with the extended overall survival of lung cancer patients. These results suggest that M1/M2 gene expression signature may be used as a prognostic indicator for lung cancer patients, and M1/M2 polarization may be a target of investigation of immune-modulating therapies for lung cancer in the future."

          "abstract": "Macrophages of the M2 phenotype in malignant tumors significantly aid tumor progression and metastasis, as opposed to the M1 phenotype that exhibits anti-cancer characteristics. Raising the ratio of M1/M2 is thus a promising strategy to ameliorate the tumor immunomicroenvironment toward cancer inhibition. We report here that tumor necrosis factor superfamily-15 (TNFSF15), a cytokine with anti-angiogenic activities, is able to facilitate the differentiation and polarization of macrophages toward M1 phenotype. We found that tumors formed in mice by Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells artificially overexpressing TNFSF15 exhibited retarded growth. The tumors displayed a greater percentage of M1 macrophages than those formed by mock-transfected LLC cells. Treatment of mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells with recombinant TNFSF15 led to augmentation of the phagocytic and pro-apoptotic capacity of the macrophages against cancer cells. Mechanistically, TNFSF15 activated STAT1/3 in bone marrow cells and MAPK, Akt and STAT1/3 in naive macrophages. Additionally, TNFSF15 activated STAT1/3 but inactivated STAT6 in M2 macrophages. Modulations of these signals gave rise to a reposition of macrophage phenotypes toward M1. The ability of TNFSF15 to promote macrophage differentiation and polarization toward M1 suggests that this unique cytokine may have a utility in the reconstruction of the immunomicroenvironment in favor of tumor suppression."

          "abstract": "M2 macrophages are the most prevalent type in the tumor microenvironment and their polarization to M1 type can be used as a potential cancer immunotherapy. Here, we investigated the role of tumor microenvironment and particularly purified exosomes in M2 to M1 macrophage polarization. Rapamycin treatment on triple-negative breast cancer cells (TNBC) was performed. Tumor cells-derived exosomes (called texosomes) were isolated and characterized using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, high-performance liquid chromatography, Fourier transform infrared, and Western blot assays. M2 mouse peritoneal macrophages were treated with rapamycin or rapamycin-texosome. Then, M1/M2 phenotype-specific marker genes and proteins were measured to assess the degree of M2 to M1 polarization. Finally, nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytosis, and efferocytosis assays were assessed to verify the functionality of the polarized macrophages. Purified rapamycin-texosomes significantly increased the expression of the M1 markers (Irf5, Nos2, and CD86) and decreased M2 markers (Arg, Ym1, and CD206). In addition, the levels of M1-specific cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 1β (IL-1β) were increased, whereas the levels of M2 specific cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta were declined. Furthermore, texosome treatment increased NO concentration and phagocytosis and decreased efferocytosis indicating M1 polarization. These findings suggest rapamycin-texosomes can induce M2 to M1 macrophages polarization as a potential immunotherapy for TNBC."

The M1-type macrophages inhibit tumor growth through the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the M2-type macrophages contribute to tumor progression through the promotion of tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Due to the duality of macrophage effects on tumors, TAMs have been a hot topic in tumor research. In this paper, the heterogeneity and plasticity of TAMs, the interactions between TAMs and other immune cells, and the effects of TAMs on tumors are reviewed, and the therapeutic strategies for TAMs are summarized and discussed. These therapeutic strategies encompass methods and approaches to inhibit the recruitment of TAMs, deplete TAMs, and modulate the polarization of TAMs. These studies help to deeply understand the mechanism of TAMs-tumor interaction and provide reference for combination therapy of tumors."

          "abstract": "Macrophages are highly plastic cells with the ability to differentiate into both M1- and M2-polarized phenotypes. As a distinct M2-polarized population, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumorigenesis owing to their pro-angiogenic and immune-suppressive functions in tumour microenvironment. In the present study, we found that the microRNA-720 (miR-720) was down-regulated in TAMs isolated from breast carcinomas and M2-polarization macrophages. Overexpression of miR-720 attenuated M2 phenotype expression and thus inhibited M2 polarization. We further identified GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), a transcriptional factor that plays an important role in M2 macrophage polarization, was the downstream target of miR-720 Ectopic expression of GATA3 restored the M2 phenotype in miR-720 overexpressed macrophages. Importantly, overexpression of miR-720 inhibited pro-migration behaviour and phagocytic ability of M2-polarized macrophages. Thus, our data suggest that miR-720 plays an important role in regulating M2 macrophage polarization and function."

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are composed of heterogeneous subpopulations, which include the M1 anti-tumor and M2 pro-tumor phenotypes. TAMs predominantly play a M2-like tumor-promoting role in the TME and regulate various malignant effects, such as angiogenesis, immune suppression, and tumor metastasis; hence, TAMs have emerged as a hot topic of research in cancer therapy. This review focuses on three main aspects of TAMs. First, we summarize macrophage polarization along with the effects on the TME. Second, recent advances and challenges in cancer treatment and the role of M2-like TAMs in immune checkpoint blockade and CAR-T cell therapy are emphasized. Finally, factors, such as signaling pathways, associated with TAM polarization and potential strategies for targeting TAM repolarization to the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype for cancer therapy are discussed."

          "abstract": "Experimental models have often been at the origin of immunological paradigms such as the M1/M2 dichotomy following macrophage polarization. However, this clear dichotomy in animal models is not as obvious in humans, and the separating line between M1-like and M2-like macrophages is rather represented by a continuum, where boundaries are still unclear. Indeed, human infectious diseases, are characterized by either a back and forth or often a mixed profile between the pro-inflammatory microenvironment (dominated by interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-α cytokines) and tissue injury driven by classically activated macrophages (M1-like) and wound healing driven by alternatively activated macrophages (M2-like) in an anti-inflammatory environment (dominated by IL-10, Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, chemokine ligand (CCL)1, CCL2, CCL17, CCL18, and CCL22). This review brews the complexity of the situation during infectious diseases by stressing on this continuum between M1-like and M2-like extremes. We first discuss the basic biology of macrophage polarization, function, and role in the inflammatory process and its resolution. Secondly, we discuss the relevance of the macrophage polarization continuum during infectious and neglected diseases, and the possibility to interfere with such activation states as a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of such diseases."

Occasionally, dumping syndrome may be a complication in patients that have undergone nissen Fundoplication, especially in adults. The BreathID® continuous online 13C-Octanoicoctanoic acid breath test detects variations of less than 1/100,000 in the 13CO2/12CO2 ratio in exhaled air. We report a case of a 38 year old male who was admitted and diagnosed with dumping syndrome following nissen Fundoplication, who was diagnosed using the BreathID® continuous online 13C-Octanoic acid breath test. Early performance of a gastric emptying rate breath test in symptomatic patients, following upper GI tract surgery may help in the prediction or diagnosis of nissen Fundoplication complications such as dumping syndrome."

Reoperation for failed fundoplication is necessary in 10 per cent of children and in 25 per cent of neurologically impaired children. In an attempt to reduce the postoperative recurrence of gastroesophageal reflux and wrap herniation, we have modified our Nissen fundoplication by reinforcing the crural repair with a horseshoe-shaped prosthetic patch. Between 1993 and 1995, 38 children underwent a Nissen fundoplication with prosthetic patch crural repair. Tension-free crural repair was performed over an esophageal dilator by suturing a horseshoe-shaped Dacron patch posterior to the esophagus. After crural repair, the standard Nissen 360 degrees wrap was constructed. Of the 38 children, 56 per cent (n = 21) were neurologically impaired. In 18 per cent of patients, the operation was performed for recurrent reflux due to wrap herniation after a Nissen fundoplication without prosthetic patch repair. One child required esophageal dilatation postoperatively for dysphagia related to esophageal stenosis. After a mean follow-up of 15 months, all patients were without symptomatic reflux or had no radiographic evidence of recurrent reflux or wrap herniation. Tension-free crural repair with a prosthetic patch may decrease postoperative reflux and wrap herniation, particularly in neurologically impaired children and in children requiring reoperation for recurrent reflux."

The role of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication after neonatal laparotomy for diseases unrelated to reflux is poorly described. This was a retrospective review of open vs laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in infants after neonatal laparotomy. Of 32 infants who underwent neonatal laparotomy, 26 required a surgical antireflux operation within the first year of life. Twelve infants underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication versus 14 infants who underwent open Nissen fundoplication. Parameters like age, weight, operative time, number of previous operations, length of stay following fundoplication, time to feedings, and complications were compared between the 2 groups. No statistically significant differences existed between most of the parameters compared following laparoscopic vs open Nissen fundoplication. No conversions to open procedures were necessary in infants undergoing laparoscopic fundoplication, and these infants resumed enteral feeds earlier than those who underwent the open procedure. Laparoscopic compared with open Nissen fundoplication performed in infants after a neonatal laparotomy were comparable procedures across most data points studied. However, a laparoscopic fundoplication did allow for earlier return to enteral feeds compared with the open approach. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication is technically feasible, safe, and effective in the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux in infants with a previous neonatal laparotomy."

In the operating room at St Luke's Episcopal Hospital, Nissen fundoplication has been taken to another level. Because of the increasing trend in laparoscopic surgery and the advanced instruments available, laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication procedures are now performed on a routine basis. One advantage of laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, as opposed to open Nissen fundoplication, is that the laparoscopic approach is far less invasive. It consists of five 11.5-mm incisions, whereas the open procedure involves a large midline incision. In addition, the overall hospital bill for the laparoscopic procedure can be less than that for an open one; for a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, the operating room bill is higher, but the hospital stay is shorter. Usually, the patient can go home the following day and resume daily tasks within days. With an open Nissen fundoplication, the hospital stay is about 3 to 5 days, and because of the large midline incision, a recovery time of 4 to 6 weeks is required. Not only can the patient resume daily activities sooner, but there is generally less pain associated with laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, and the overall hospital bill is less because of the days spent in the hospital for postoperative recovery."

However, the literature reports that a persistent, small group of patients is not fully satisfied with the outcome. Identifying this patient group preoperatively would prevent disappointment for both patients and surgeon. This has proven difficult since dissatisfaction was related to nondisease-related factors instead of typical symptoms of GERD or the objective findings of investigations. We studied our series of patients who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication to identify predictors of patient dissatisfaction and the impact of surgery on individual symptoms. All consecutive private patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication were asked to complete a preoperative and postoperative questionnaire concerning symptoms, medication use, and satisfaction. Demographics, investigations, complications, and reinterventions were documented. A standard laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed. Over an 11-year period 222 patients underwent surgery for GERD. The postoperative response rate to the questionnaire was 77.5 %, with dissatisfaction reported by 12.8 % of the patients. Of these dissatisfied patients, only 13.6 % had proven disease recurrence. Both satisfied and dissatisfied patients presented with an inconsistent pattern of symptoms. None of the preoperative symptoms and investigations or the patient's age and gender was predictive of postoperative dissatisfaction. Only postoperative heartburn, regurgitation, and bloating significantly correlated with patient dissatisfaction. Nissen fundoplication has a very high satisfaction rate overall. A small percentage of patients are not fully satisfied and dissatisfaction is associated with reported persistent symptoms and side effects of surgery rather than gender or preoperative symptom pattern, severity of esophagitis, or total 24 h esophageal acid exposure."

However, failure rates of Nissen fundoplication in this population are higher, and alternatives to Nissen fundoplication have technical and functional disadvantages. We hypothesize that the novel gastroplasty with restricted antrum to control emesis (GRACE) would be more effective than Nissen fundoplication at reducing emetic reflux. To compare the GRACE with Nissen fundoplication, 15 canine subjects were randomized to Nissen fundoplication or GRACE. All subjects underwent gastrostomy tube placement. Baseline gastric emptying, electrogastrography, and induced vomiting studies were performed. Nissen fundoplication or GRACE was then performed. Postoperatively, gastric emptying and vomiting studies were repeated. Gastric emptying before and after antireflux procedures was not significantly different between groups. Both Nissen fundoplication (38%, P = .04) and GRACE (69%, P < .01) procedures prevented reflux compared with baseline. However, the GRACE procedure significantly reduced reflux when compared with Nissen fundoplication (P = .03). In this canine model, GRACE appears to be significantly more effective than Nissen fundoplication at reducing emetic reflux. This novel procedure preserves gastric function and is well tolerated. The GRACE procedure may provide an alternative to Nissen fundoplication as a primary or repeat antireflux procedure for children with neurologic impairment."

PCR-based analysis of lymphocyte DNA documented that the ring contained sequences from both the short and the long arm of the Y chromosome. X-chromosome analysis using a panel of highly polymorphic markers indicated that the ring contained material derived only from Xp22.1 to Xp21.3.

The r(X) appears to be inactivated since a buccal smear demonstrated 5% Barr bodies. Furthermore, DAPI stain and FISH analysis with the X-centromere DNA probe DXZ1 was employed to distinguish the inactive X from the active X, and verified the presence of a sex chromatin mass in fibroblasts.

Her phenotype actually was quite consistent with Russell-Silver syndrome. She had a triangular face with prominent forehead, large eyes, a thin nose, malar hypoplasia, thin upper lip with down-turned corner of the mouth and a pointed chin. Marked body asymmetry was evident at birth, with the left side significantly smaller than the right side. She has a diphalangeal left fifth finger. Skin fibroblast culture and analysis showed a karyotype of 45,X on the right side and 45,X/46,XX on the left side. The case is another illustration of the genetic heterogeneity of Russell-Silver phenotype."

A 29-year-old woman underwent complete ophthalmologic and general examination. Incomplete development of the angle with iris stromal hypoplasia and prominent posterior embryotoxon with iris adhesions were noted. Disc drusen was confirmed by ultrasonography. Visual fields were normal other than bilateral enlargement of blind spot. Intraocular pressure was under 21 mm Hg during 8 years of follow-up without medication. The patient had atrial septal defect, sensorineural hearing loss, polycystic ovaries, hirsutism, glomerulosclerosis, dental anomalies, and low intelligence. A chromosome analysis revealed that she had mosaic Turner syndrome with a 45,X/46,XX karyotype. Few reported cases in the literature describe the coexistence of Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome and Turner syndrome mosaicism. Somatic and anterior chamber malformations in this patient represent a developmental disorder of the neural crest. General examination and chromosomal analysis are indicated in patients presenting with anterior chamber dysgenesis."

          "abstract": "Large amounts of ATP are produced in mitochondria especially in the brain and heart, where energy consumption is high compared with other organs. Thus, a decrease in ATP production in such organs could be a cause of many diseases such as neurodegenerative diseases and heart disease. Based on thus assumption, increasing intracellular ATP production in such organs could be a therapeutic strategy. In this study, we report on the delivery of vitamin B<sub>1</sub>, a coenzyme that activates the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, to the inside of mitochondria. Since the TCA cycle is responsible for ATP production, we hypothesized delivering vitamin B<sub>1</sub> to mitochondria would enhance ATP production. To accomplish this, we used a mitochondrial targeted liposome a \"MITO-Porter\" as the carrier. Using SH-SY5Y cells, a model neuroblast, cellular uptake and intracellular localization were analyzed using flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The optimized MITO-Porter containing encapsulated vitamin B<sub>1</sub> (MITO-Porter (VB<sub>1</sub>)) was efficiently accumulated in mitochondria of SH-SY5Y cells. Further studies confirmed that the level of ATP production after the MITO-Porter (VB<sub>1</sub>) treatment was significantly increased as compared to a control group that was treated with naked vitamin B<sub>1</sub>. This study provides the potential for an innovative therapeutic strategy in which the TCA cycle is activated, thus enhancing ATP production."

While cells can communicate with each other via secretion of extracellular vesicles, less is known regarding organelle-to organelle communication, particularly in the case of mitochondria. Mitochondria are responsible for the production of energy and for essential metabolic pathways in the cell, as well as fundamental processes such as apoptosis and aging. Here, we show that functional mitochondria isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae release vesicles, independent of the fission machinery. We isolate these mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) and find that they are relatively uniform in size, of about 100 nm, and carry selective protein cargo enriched for ATP synthase subunits. Remarkably, we further find that these MDVs harbor a functional ATP synthase complex. We demonstrate that these vesicles have a membrane potential, produce ATP, and seem to fuse with naive mitochondria. Our findings reveal a possible delivery mechanism of ATP-producing vesicles, which can potentially regenerate ATP-deficient mitochondria and may participate in organelle-to-organelle communication."

We uncovered an interesting statistical regularity: in well-fed protists, relatively elevated values of mitochondrion power cluster around the smallest cell sizes and the medium-large cell sizes. In contrast, in starved protists and metazoans, the relation between mitochondrion power and cell size is inconclusive, and in microalgae and plants, mitochondrion power seems to increase from smaller cells to larger ones (where this investigation includes plant cells of volume up to ca. 2.18 × 10<sup>5</sup> μm<sup>3</sup>).

Here we use Drosophila melanogaster to reveal daily shifts in whole animal ATP production in a tight 24 hours' time series. We show a marked production peak in the morning that declines around midday and remains low through afternoon and night. ATP production can be improved with long wavelengths (>660 nm), but apparently not at all times. Hence, we treated flies with 670 nm light to reveal optimum times. Exposures at 670 nm resulted in a significant ATP increases and a shift in the ATP/adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio at 8.00 and 11.00, whilst application at other time points had no effect. Hence, light-induced ATP increases appear limited to periods when natural production is high. In summary, long wavelength influences on mitochondria are conserved across species from fly to human. Determining times for their administration to improve function in ageing and disease are of key importance. This study progresses this problem."

Mitochondria, a double-membrane organelle, generate approximately 90% of cellular energy as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through oxidative phosphorylation, utilizing the electrochemical gradient established by the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial function is compromised by damage to mitochondrial DNA, including point mutations, deletions, duplications, or inversions. Additionally, disruptions to proteins associated with mitochondrial membranes regulating metabolic homeostasis can impair the respiratory chain's efficiency. This results in diminished ATP production and increased generation of reactive oxygen species. This review provides an overview of mutations affecting mitochondrial transporters and proteins involved in mitochondrial energy synthesis, particularly those involved in ATP synthesis and mobilization, and it examines their role in the pathogenesis of specific cardiomyopathies."

However, the ATP production process is associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which excessive accumulation can cause mitochondrial dysfunction. This dysfunction, in turn, causes the accumulation of fatty acids in the adipose tissue, triggering a local inflammatory process that can evolve into systemic inflammation. In women with obesity, an increase in lipid levels in the placental environment is observed. The high presence of fatty acids compromises the structural integrity and mitochondrial membrane, culminating in the release of ROS. This process damages the DNA of placental cells and causes an inflammatory state, affecting metabolic efficiency. This vicious cycle is characterized by defects in mitochondrial ATP production, which can lead to lipid accumulation and inflammation. In pregnant women with obesity, these mitochondrial changes play a determining role in pregnancy outcomes. Hence, the objective of this study was to search the literature to review the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction in the maternal obesity."

Disruption of the outer membrane of isotonically prepared mitochondria lead to a selective loss of the glycerol-3 phosphate induced ATP production, indicating that glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a soluble enzyme of the intermembrane space. Isolation of mitochondria under hypotonic conditions, therefore, results in disruption of the outer membrane, whereas in the organelles isolated under isotonic conditions both the membranes remain intact."

Sex, age at the time of Kasai, preoperative laboratory tests, success rates (defined as postoperative total serum bilirubin < or = 2.0 mg/dL), and survival rate were recorded. Differences between African-American (AA; n = 30) and white (W; n = 33) children were analyzed. Long-term follow-up was available on 59 of 63 patients. Sixty-three percent of all patients (40 of 65) were girls, and 48% were AA (30 of 63). A higher percentage of AA children (73%) were girls than were white children (55%), although this difference did not achieve statistical significance. African-Americans underwent portoenterostomy at a later age, had higher alkaline phosphatase levels, and higher AST. These differences were statistically significant. Preoperative ALT, total bilirubin level, and GGTP levels all were greater in African-Americans, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. There was a trend toward decreased success and survival rate, although these results also were not statistically significant. African-Americans underwent primary therapeutic intervention for biliary atresia at an older age than white children with a trend toward less favorable results. These differences related to race may be attributed to greater difficulty in diagnosing jaundice or poorer access to health care in this patient population.

The European Biliary Atresia Registry (EBAR) was set up to improve data collection and to develop a pan-national and interdisciplinary strategy to improve clinical outcomes. From 2001 to 2005, 100 centers from 22 countries registered with EBAR via its website (www.biliary-atresia.com). In June 2006, the first meeting was held to evaluate results and launch further initiatives. During a 5-year period, 60 centers from 19 European countries and Israel sent completed registration forms for a total of 514 BA patients. Assuming the estimated incidence of BA in Europe is 1:18,000 live births, 35% of the expected 1488 patients from all EBAR participating countries were captured, suggesting that reporting arrangements need improvement. At the meeting, the cumulative evaluation of 928 BA patients including patients from other registries with variable follow-up revealed an overall survival of 78% (range from 41% to 92%), of whom 342 patients (37%) have had liver transplants. Survival with native liver ranged from 14% to 75%. There was a marked variance in reported management and outcome by country (e.g., referral patterns, timing of surgery, centralization of surgery). In conclusion, EBAR represents the first attempt at an overall evaluation of the outcome of BA from a pan-European perspective. The natural history and outcome of biliary atresia is of considerable relevance to a European population. It is essential that there is further support for a pan-European registry with coordination of clinical standards, further participation of parent support groups, and implementation of online data entry and multidisciplinary clinical and basic research projects."

The mean delay in diagnosis was 5 days; however, the delay was 8 days for patients admitted to the medical wards compared with 2 days in the surgical wards (P less than 0.001). Elective operations were performed on 82% of patients and 18% had urgent surgery. The incidence of common bile duct stones was 22%. The overall mortality rate was 10%; however, the mortality rate was 3.2% for the under-60-year-old group compared with 21% for patients 60 years and older (P = 0.006). This series, which is probably the largest reported in black patients, suggests that greater awareness of acute cholecystitis is necessary in the black patient since there is a rising in-hospital incidence."

          "abstract": "Gluten intolerance is an umbrella term for gluten-related disorders manifested in health decline as a result of the gluten ingestion. The spectrum of gluten-related disorders includes three major groups: autoimmune (mainly, Celiac Disease, CD, also known as Celiac Sprue, dermatitis herpetiformis, or gluten-sensitive ataxia), allergic (wheat allergy, WA), and non-autoimmune non-allergic (non-celiac gluten sensitivity, NCGS, or gluten sensitivity, GS). Pathogenesis and diagnostics of CD and WA are well established in contrast to NCGS, pathogenicity of which is still poorly understood and its symptoms are frequently misdiagnosed since most of the NCGS cases are currently identified via the process of CD and WA exclusion. By now, the only one proven effective way for CD treatment is gluten-free diet (GFD). However, such an increasingly gaining popularity diet is apparently unsuitable for NCGS treatment because in this case gluten does not always arise as the major or exclusive culprit of gastrointestinal disorder. Furthermore, it is some physicians' opinion that GFD can be deficient in fiber and in other vitamins and minerals. In many cases, GFD is commercially inaccessible for the most needy, whereas strict adherence to the diet is complicated by the presence of small amounts of the gluten components in some foods and even medicines. In this regard, a number of research groups and pharmaceutical companies are extensively developing alternative medicinal approaches to GFD for effective gluten intolerance treatment. This review summarizes our understanding of gluten-related disorders, possible mechanisms of gluten intolerance activation and advantages of gluten intolerance medicinal treatment using novel drug candidates obtained with a proper pharmaceutical design."

          "abstract": "Theterm gluten intolerance may refer to three types of human disorders: autoimmune celiac disease (CD), allergy to wheat and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Gluten is a mixture of prolamin proteins present mostly in wheat, but also in barley, rye and oat. Gluten can be subdivided into three major groups: S-rich, S-poor and high molecular weight proteins. Prolamins within the groups possess similar structures and properties. All gluten proteins are evolutionarily connected and share the same ancestral origin. Gluten proteins are highly resistant to hydrolysis mediated by proteases of the human gastrointestinal tract. It results in emergence of pathogenic peptides, which cause CD and allergy in genetically predisposed people. There is a hierarchy of peptide toxicity and peptide recognition by T cells. Nowadays, there are several ways to detoxify gluten peptides: the most common is gluten-free diet (GFD), which has proved its effectiveness; prevention programs, enzymatic therapy, correction of gluten pathogenicity pathways and genetically modified grains with reduced immunotoxicity. A deep understanding of gluten intolerance underlying mechanisms and detailed knowledge of gluten properties may lead to the emergence of novel effective approaches for treatment of gluten-related disorders."

          "abstract": "The term gluten-related disorders (GRD) refers to a spectrum of diverse clinical manifestations triggered by the ingestion of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. They include both intestinal and extraintestinal manifestations. Gluten ataxia (GA) is one of the commonest neurological manifestations of GRD. It was originally defined as otherwise idiopathic sporadic ataxia in the presence of circulating antigliadin antibodies of IgA and/or IgG type. Newer more specific serological markers have been identified but are not as yet readily available. GA has a prevalence of 15% amongst all ataxias and 40% of all idiopathic sporadic ataxias. It usually presents with gait and lower limb ataxia. It is of insidious onset with a mean age at onset of 53 years. Up to 40% of patients have evidence of enteropathy on duodenal biopsy. Gastrointestinal symptoms are seldom prominent and are not a reliable indicator for the presence of enteropathy. Furthermore, the presence of enteropathy does not influence the response to a gluten-free diet. Most patients will stabilise or improve with strict adherence to gluten-free diet depending on the duration of the ataxia prior to the treatment. Up to 60% of patients with GA have evidence of cerebellar atrophy on MR imaging, but all patients have spectroscopic abnormalities primarily affecting the vermis. Recent evidence suggests that patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease presenting to the gastroenterologists have abnormal MR spectroscopy at presentation associated with clinical evidence of subtle cerebellar dysfunction. The advantage of early diagnosis and treatment (mean age 42 years in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms vs. 53 years in patients presenting with ataxia) may protect the first group from the development and/or progression of neurological dysfunction."

Celiac disease (CD), dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), gluten ataxia (GA), wheat allergy (WA), and non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) are the five major GRDs that present with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of GRDs can be challenging because the typical and atypical clinical manifestations of the GRDs overlap. In this review, the current definitions of gluten-related disorders, focusing on their clinical features, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are presented. We concluded that GRDs are usually diagnosed using a combination of clinical features, serological tests, and histopathological findings. Treatment usually involves dietary modification."

          "abstract": "Wheat sensitivity is a collective term for several, especially gastrointestinal, diseases that occur as part of a hypersensitivity reaction after wheat consumption. The symptoms, which are mostly similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome, are often accompanied by skin lesions. In addition to celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, the cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease, wheat sensitivity also includes nonceliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), allergic nickel contact mucositis, wheat allergy, amylase-trypsin inhibitor intolerance, and fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) intolerance. This review article aims to provide an overview of the clinical, especially dermatological and gastrointestinal features of the different forms of wheat sensitivity. Diagnosis and therapeutic management are also discussed. A selective literature search was carried out with evaluation of our own clinical data. The skin lesions in dermatitis herpetiformis are very disease-specific. In contrast, wheat allergy often shares signs and symptoms with many other diseases. Other forms of wheat sensitivity cause primarily gastrointestinal abnormalities, but extra-intestinal manifestations can also occur. Their diagnosis is often complex and requires cross-disciplinary collaboration with experts in gastroenterology. The therapy consists of a wheat- or gluten-free diet. Knowledge of the different and frequently occurring dermatological signs of wheat sensitivity is of great importance, because dermatological manifestations associated with gastrointestinal pathology, intolerance reactions, and allergies appear more and more frequently."

In children, the risk of neurological complications is lower, and gluten sensitivity with neurological presentation seems to be rare. We report a case of gluten sensitivity with severe neurological presentation in a 3-year-old girl. In the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, the presence of white matter lesions in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging suggested an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Recurrence of neurologic symptoms and cerebral lesions over a long period of time made the authors consider an autoimmune/inflammatory systemic disease. IgA anti-transglutaminase (TG) 2 was elevated and duodenal biopsy confirmed the presence of enteropathy. A gluten-free diet led to complete resolution of neurological manifestations and arrest of white matter lesions progression. In children with unclear neurologic manifestations with probable autoimmune etiology, anti-TG2 autoantibody titers should be determined considering the possibility of gluten sensitivity. Gluten-free diet remains the only effective treatment reported to date and, therefore, should be recommended to all patients with gluten sensitivity despite the type of manifestations. More studies, focusing on neurological manifestations and its response to gluten-free diet, are needed."

Because of the lack of biomarkers for NCGS diagnosis, the cornerstone for its assessment is a single- or double-blind placebo-controlled (DBPC) gluten challenge. However, there are some non-standardized points in the diagnostic approach proposed by the experts. This complicate comparisons among the results published by different research groups. The gluten vehicle and placebo must be indistinguishable from each other, which entails sensory and technological evaluations of the designed gluten vehicle and placebo products. At the moment, there is no standardized method for the preparation of the gluten vehicle and placebo for carrying out DBPC gluten challenges for NCGS assessment. This review focuses on the challenges that researchers have to face, either for the development of an accepted gluten vehicle and placebo or for identifying NCGS cases on the basis of DBPC gluten challenges."

This trend has led to the identification of a new clinical entity termed noncoeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). In this Review, we discuss the evidence for NCGS as demonstrated by the results of double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary rechallenge studies. Furthermore, the characteristic phenotype of individuals with NCGS is described as well as the symptom manifestations commonly reported after gluten exposure, which include intestinal symptoms consistent with IBS, and extraintestinal symptoms such as neurological dysfunction, psychological disturbances, fibromyalgia and skin rash. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that NCGS can be associated with organic gastrointestinal pathologies, such as IBD, in which its presence might be a reflection of severe or stricturing disease. However, NCGS is not without its controversies and uncertainties, in particular pertaining to whether it is gluten or nongluten components of the grain evoking symptoms; evidence suggests that fermentable carbohydrates, amylase trypsin inhibitors and wheat-germ agglutinin can also be responsible culprits. Finally, we discuss the novel techniques that might help diagnose NCGS in the future."

Here, we have profiled T cells in the CSF of healthy human donors and have identified signatures related to cytotoxic capacity and tissue adaptation that are further exemplified in clonally expanded CSF T cells. By comparing profiles of clonally expanded T cells obtained from the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy donors, we report that clonally expanded T cells from the CSF of patients with MS have heightened expression of genes related to T cell activation and cytotoxicity."

In healthy individuals, the T cells of the immune system, when activated by an infectious agent, regularly traffic across an intact blood-brain barrier, survey the CNS and then leave. In MS, for reasons that are only gradually being understood, certain events in the peripheral immune response and in the brain cause some autoreactive T cells to stay in the CNS. Their presence initiates infiltration by other leukocytes and activation and recruitment of endogenous glia to the inflammatory process, ultimately leading to the destruction of myelin and the myelin-producing cell, the oligodendrocyte, and the dysfunction of axons. The key mediators in the subsequent cycles of histological damage and repair, and clinical relapse and remission are thought to be adhesion molecules, chemokines and cytokines."

Animal models of MS have shown that CNS-specific T cells are present in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy mice and cause autoimmune disease only when they are activated by immunization. T cell entry into the CNS is thought to require some form of peripheral activation because the blood-brain barrier prohibits trafficking of this tissue by naive cells. We report here that naive T cells can traffic to the CNS without prior activation. Comparable numbers of T cells are found in the CNS of both healthy recombinase activating gene (Rag)(-/)- T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice even when the transgenic TCR is specific for a CNS antigen. Transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for non-CNS antigens are phenotypically naive and proliferate robustly to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Strikingly, transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) are also primarily phenotypically naive but are unresponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Mononuclear cells from the CNS of MBP TCR transgenic but not nontransgenic mice can suppress the response of peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These results indicate that naive MBP-specific T cells can traffic to the CNS but do not trigger autoimmunity because they undergo tolerance induction in situ."

Thus, the CNS is routinely surveyed by immune competent cells; yet the healthy brain is not a target of antigen-specific immune reactions. Therefore, mechanisms must exist to prevent brain-antigen-specific T-cells from inducing immune responses. Data indicate that activated T-cells entering the CNS may undergo apoptosis rather than leaving the brain to induce immune responses. Applying RT-PCR, Western-blots, and immunocytochemistry, we have demonstrated expression of the apoptosis-inducing protein Fas ligand on astrocytes and neurons of apparently normal rat and human brains. FasL-positive astrocytes were often situated in close vicinity to cerebral blood vessels in vivo and induced apoptosis of Fas expressing Jurkat cells in vitro. We propose that similar to other immune privileged organs FasL-induced apoptosis of activated T-cells in the brain protects the tissue from self damaging immune attacks by forming an immunological brain barrier."

          "abstract": "Trafficking of inflammatory T cells into the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. The directional migratory ability of peripheral T cells is associated with interactions of chemokines with their receptors expressed on T cells. In this study, transmigration of peripheral T cells toward a panel of chemokines was examined in patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy individuals using Boyden chemotactic transwells. A significantly increased migratory rate preferentially toward RANTES and MIP-1alpha, but not other chemokines, was found in T cells obtained from multiple sclerosis patients as opposed to healthy individuals (P: < 0.001). The migratory T-cell populations represented predominantly Th1/Th0 cells while non-migratory T cells were enriched for Th2-like cells. The study demonstrated further that aberrant migration of multiple sclerosis-derived T cells toward RANTES and MIP-1 alpha resulted from overexpression of their receptors (CCR5) and could be blocked by anti-CCR5 antibodies. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanism underlying aberrant T cell trafficking in multiple sclerosis."

The pathology of MS is largely attributed to autoreactive effector T cells that penetrate the blood-brain barrier and become activated within the CNS. As autoreactive T cells are present in the blood of both patients with MS and healthy individuals, other regulatory mechanisms exist to prevent autoreactive T cells from causing immune disorders. Active suppression by regulatory T (Treg) cells plays a key role in the control of self-antigen-reactive T cells and the induction of peripheral tolerance in vivo. In particular, the importance of antigen-specific Treg cells in conferring genetic resistance to organ-specific autoimmunity and in limiting autoimmune tissue damage has been documented in many disease models including MS. We have found that the frequency of Tregs in MS patients is unchanged from controls, but their function measured in vitro may be diminished, correlating with impaired inhibitory activity in vivo. This review discusses the immunopathology of MS with particular focus given to regulatory T cells and their potential for the development of new therapies to treat this disease."

The physiological mechanisms controlling this entry have not been elucidated. This study reports that T-cell entry into the rat CNS appears to be primarily dependent upon the activation state of the lymphocytes; T-lymphoblasts enter the CNS (and all other tissues examined) in an apparently random manner while T cells not in blast phase are excluded. Antigen specificity, MHC compatibility, T-cell phenotype, and T-cell receptor gene usage do not appear related to the ability of cells to enter. This study demonstrates that when T-lymphoblasts are introduced into the circulation they rapidly appear in the CNS tissue. Their concentration in the CNS reaches a peak between 9 and 12 hr, and lymphocytes which have entered, exit within 1 to 2 days. Cells capable of reacting with a CNS antigen remain in the tissue or cyclically reenter to initiate inflammation if they are able to recognize their antigen in the correct MHC context. This observation also appears to pertain to the entry of activated T cells into many other tissues, although their concentrations in these non-CNS sites was not quantitated."

The aim of the review was a brief description of the classification and pathophysiology of kidney stone disease, along with the short characteristics of drug-induced urinary stones. This type of stones is formed as a result of crystallisation in the kidneys and urinary tract of sparingly soluble drugs and their metabolites, or as a result of metabolic changes caused by drugs, predestinating the development of stones containing endogenous compounds.

The predominance of oxalate stones was seen in kidney stones with mixed composition (83%) and the prevalence of uric acid stones (54%) was revealed in \"pure\" kidney stones. Urinary stones with a predominance of oxalates had significantly less impurities (12,4%) than stones with a predominance of uric acid, phosphates and carbonates with average amount of impurities more than 24%. Conslusion. The analysis of stone composition with a consideration of pathogenic factor showed that disorders of calcium metabolism in the population of the European part of the Russian Federation prevailed (88%)."

Over the years, treatment of kidney stones has evolved radically, but a standard approach for transplanted kidneys has not yet been defined. Here, we present a 69-year-old male patient who received successful treatment of nephrolithiasis of the transplanted kidney. The patient, who had received a kidney from a deceased donor, was admitted to our department following a posttransplant Doppler ultrasonography showing severe hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney associated with acute renal function decay. Computed tomography scan confirmed the hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney, showing a large, impacted, ureteropelvic 3-cm-diameter stone and other concretions around the ureteral stent. The patient was then treated with retrograde intrarenal surgery during an open ureterotomy. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he showed good functional reprise and a rapid decrease of serum creatinine levels. Intraoperative retrograde intrarenal surgery could be a valid option for treatment of kidney stones of the transplanted kidney during open surgery of the ureter or during ureterovesical anastomosis."

Renal stone formation is a complex multistep process that includes supersaturation, crystal nucleation, growth, and aggregation. In the early stage of crystal formation, exposure to high concentrations of oxalate can induce renal tubular cell injury, following crystal attachment to renal tubular cell in which stone matrix proteins or urinary high molecular substances play an important role as a promoter or inhibitor respectively. Recent study speculated that renal macrophage could englobe crystals and might digest them. In this part, we propose the molecular mechanism that has been newly investigated recently, in renal stone formation."

The most common chemical composition of kidney stones is calcium oxalate that initiates stone formation by crystallization, crystal growth, crystal aggregation, crystal-cell adhesion, and crystal invasion through extracellular matrix in renal interstitium. Among these processes, crystal-cell interactions (defined as \"the phenomena in which the cell is altered by any means of effects from the crystal that adheres onto cellular surface or is internalized into the cell, accompanying with changes of the crystal, e.g., growth, adhesive capability, degradation, etc., induced by the cell\") are very important for crystal retention in the kidney. During the past 12 years, proteomics has been extensively applied to kidney stone research aiming for better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of kidney stone formation. This article provides an overview of the current knowledge in this field and summarizes the data obtained from all the studies that applied proteomics to the investigations of crystal-cell interactions that subsequently led to functional studies to address the significant impact or functional roles of the expression proteomics data in the pathogenesis of kidney stone disease."

We investigated the ability of L pneumophila to adhere to various types of materials such as those found in the hospital air-cooling and portable water distribution systems. Through the use of a unique sampling apparatus, we were able to regularly acquire planktonic and sessile samples and determine the numbers of bacteria present in both populations, in vitro and in situ. Portions of these apparatuses could be aseptically removed for examination by scanning electron microscopy, or for the determination of the number of viable adherent L pneumophila. The number of bacteria present in each sample was determined by direct plate count, with presumptive L pneumophila colonies being positively identified by direct fluorescent antibody staining techniques. The results demonstrated that not only are legionellae capable of colonizing various metallic and nonmetallic surfaces but that they are preferentially found on surfaces. Surface-adherent bacteria may play a profound role as a reservoir of these potential pathogens in aquatic environments. Furthermore, these results suggest that any comprehensive legionella monitoring program must include not only water samples but also an examination of the adherent populations."

          "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila has been shown to survive and multiply in a variety of intracellular environments, including protozoa and human mononuclear phagocytes. However, the mechanism by which this organism acquires iron in the intracellular environment has not been studied. Since L. pneumophila does not produce siderophores, alternative methods of iron acquisition were investigated. Virulent strains of L. pneumophila were able to grow in media containing as little as 3 microM iron, whereas avirulent cells required a minimum of 13 microM iron for growth. Neither virulent nor avirulent cells were able to utilize 55Fe bound to transferrin. When incubated in the presence of 55Fe in the form of ferric chloride, both virulent and avirulent cells accumulated equal amounts of iron. The uptake of iron was energy dependent as indicated by inhibition of 55Fe uptake at 4 degrees C and preincubation of the cells with KCN. Treatment of virulent cells with pronase or trypsin had no effect on iron uptake. In contrast, pronase or trypsin treatment of avirulent cells resulted in increased uptake of iron. Iron reductase activity in both virulent and avirulent cells was demonstrated, with the highest specific activity associated with the periplasmic fraction. Maximum reductase activity of virulent cells occurred with NADH as the reductant. In contrast, avirulent cells showed a twofold increase in enzyme activity when NADPH was used as the reductant. These results suggest that an iron reductase is important in iron acquisition by L. pneumophila."

          "abstract": "<i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is a Gram-negative bacterium ubiquitous in freshwater environments which, if inhaled, can cause a severe pneumonia in humans. The emergence of <i>L. pneumophila</i> is linked to several traits selected in the environment, the acquisition of some of which involved intra- and interkingdom horizontal gene transfer events. Transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) is a powerful method to identify the genetic basis of selectable traits as well as to identify fitness determinants and essential genes, which are possible antibiotic targets. TIS has not yet been used to its full power in <i>L. pneumophila</i>, possibly because of the difficulty of obtaining a high-saturation transposon insertion library. Indeed, we found that isolates of sequence type 1 (ST1), which includes the commonly used laboratory strains, are poorly permissive to saturating mutagenesis by conjugation-mediated transposon delivery. In contrast, we obtained high-saturation libraries in non-ST1 clinical isolates, offering the prospect of using TIS on unaltered <i>L. pneumophila</i> strains. Focusing on one of them, we then used TIS to identify essential genes in <i>L. pneumophila</i> We also revealed that TIS could be used to identify genes controlling vertical transmission of mobile genetic elements. We then applied TIS to identify all the genes required for <i>L. pneumophila</i> to develop competence and undergo natural transformation, defining the set of major and minor type IV pilins that are engaged in DNA uptake. This work paves the way for the functional exploration of the <i>L. pneumophila</i> genome by TIS and the identification of the genetic basis of other life traits of this species.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Legionella pneumophila</i> is the etiologic agent of a severe form of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia in humans. The environmental life traits of <i>L. pneumophila</i> are essential to its ability to accidentally infect humans. A comprehensive identification of their genetic basis could be obtained through the use of transposon insertion sequencing. However, this powerful approach had not been fully implemented in <i>L. pneumophila</i> Here, we describe the successful implementation of the transposon-sequencing approach in a clinical isolate of <i>L. pneumophila</i> We identify essential genes, potential drug targets, and genes required for horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. This work represents an important step toward identifying the genetic basis of the many life traits of this environmental and pathogenic species."

This article offers an overview of the recent findings on ChP alterations in MS, with a focus on the imaging tools able to detect these abnormalities and on their involvement in inflammation, tissue damage and repair. On MRI, ChPs are enlarged in people with MS (PwMS) versus healthy individuals. This size increase is an early event, already detected in presymptomatic and pediatric MS. Enlargement of ChPs is linked to local inflammatory infiltrates, and their dysfunction selectively impacts periventricular damage, larger ChPs predicting the expansion of chronic active lesions, smoldering inflammation and remyelination failure in tissues surrounding the ventricles. ChP volumetry may add value for the prediction of disease activity and disability worsening. ChP imaging metrics are emerging as possible biomarkers of neuroinflammation and repair failure in MS. Future works combining multimodal imaging techniques should provide a more refined characterization of ChP functional changes, their link with tissue damage, blood to cerebrospinal-fluid barrier dysfunction and fluid trafficking in MS."

Understanding the specific clinical and molecular properties of the choroid will shed new light on the pathogenesis of the broad clinical range of chorioretinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy and other diseases within the pachychoroid spectrum, uveitis, and diabetic choroidopathy. Although our knowledge is still relatively limited with respect to the clinical features and molecular pathways that underlie these chorioretinal diseases, we summarise new approaches and discuss future directions for gaining new insights into these sight-threatening diseases and highlight new therapeutic strategies such as pluripotent stem cell‒based technologies and gene therapy."

          "abstract": "One of the notable features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the overabundance of beta-amyloid peptides in brain fluids, leading to the formation and deposition of insoluble amyloid plaques. Previous work in this lab demonstrates that the normal choroid plexus, a primary component of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, has the capacity to remove beta-amyloid from the cerebrospinal fluid, potentially preventing the formation of beta-amyloid plaques. The purpose of this work was to determine whether the choroid plexus and/or the brain capillaries, a primary component of the blood-brain barrier, possessed the capacity to produce or degrade beta-amyloid peptides. Using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, immunodetection and enzyme activity assays, we demonstrated the presence in brain barriers of several key enzymes involved in beta-amyloid production, namely, amyloid precursor protein and beta-secretase, and in beta-amyloid metabolism and alternate processing, such as insulin degrading enzyme, endothelin-converting enzyme-1, neprilysin and alpha-secretase. Furthermore, beta-amyloid presence, in the absence of its application in culture media, was detected in an immortalized choroidal epithelial cell line, known as Z310 cells. The ability of the choroid plexus to produce and degrade beta-amyloid, in addition to its transport function, suggests a vital role of this tissue in maintaining beta-amyloid homeostasis. Disruption of this homeostasis due to aging, injury or toxicant exposure may contribute to accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides in the brain fluids, leading to AD."

Our aim was to provide structural and phenotypic evidence of lymphatic-like structures in the human choroid, including details of its development. Using multiple-marker immunohistochemistry (IHC), choroids from human fetal eyes (8-26 weeks gestation) and adults (17-74 years) were examined with lymphatic- and vascular-specific markers: prospero homeobox-1 (PROX-1), lymphatic vascular endothelium receptor-1 (LYVE-1), podoplanin, D2-40, endomucin, VEGF-C, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3 or Flt4), UEA lectin, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), CD34, and CD39. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to establish evidence for choroidal lymphatics, and to provide details of stratification and relative frequency of lymphatics compared to choroidal blood vessels. Immunohistochemistry and TEM indicated a central-to-peripheral topography of lymphatic formation, with numerous blind-ended lymph sacs just external to the choriocapillaris, as well as the presence of infrequent precollector and collector lymphatic channels. Characteristic ultrastructural features of lymphatics in adult human choroid included anchoring filaments, luminal flocculent protein but absence of erythrocytes, fragmented and/or absent basal lamina, absence of intracellular Weibel-Palade bodies, infrequent pericyte ensheathment, and lack of fenestrae. The system of blind-ended initial lymphatic segments seen just external to the fenestrated vessels of the choriocapillaris is ideally placed for recirculating extracellular fluid and strategically placed for immune surveillance. The presence of a system of lymphatic-like channels in the human choroid provides an anatomical basis for antigen presentation in the posterior eye, with a possible route from the eye to the sentinel lymph nodes, similar to that already described for anterior eye lymphatics."

CVI is a potential tool in establishing early diagnoses, monitoring disease progression and prognosticating patients.

To obtain more information about the role of this innervation, the authors examined the presence and spatial organization of nitrergic and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) immunoreactive nerves in the human choroid. For comparison, the choroid of rabbit and rat eyes, with different types of retinal vascularization and no fovea, were studied. Whole mounts of five human, nine rat, and two rabbit choroids were stained for NADPH-diaphorase. In addition, immunocytochemical staining was carried out on tangential frozen sections of two human choroids using antibodies against nitric oxide synthase (NOS), synaptophysin, and VIP. In all species, a perivascular network of diaphorase-positive nerve fibers with varicose terminals accompanied the arteries and arterioles of the choroidal stroma. A striking difference to rat and rabbit choroids was the presence of numerous positively stained ganglion cells in human choroids. Positively stained axons connected the neurons with each other and with the perivascular network. Most of the ganglion cells were concentrated in the temporal-central region, adjacent to the fovea. Immunocytochemically, the choroidal ganglion cells were immunoreactive for NOS. Some ganglion cells stained for VIP. Staining for synaptophysin demonstrated varicose terminals innervating the perikarya of the ganglion cells. Many of these terminals stained for NOS and VIP. The presence of an intrinsic nerve cell plexus that is specifically localized in human eyes in the temporal-central portion of the choroid indicates a functional significance of the nitrergic choroidal innervation for the fovea."

There is also substantial evidence, particularly from animal studies, that the choroid plays an important role in the regulation of eye growth and the development of common refractive errors like myopia. In recent years, advances in optical coherence tomography technology have improved our ability to image and measure the choroid in the human eye. Research using this technology over the past decade has dramatically improved our knowledge of the normal choroid, and its potential role in the regulation of eye growth and refractive error development. This review aims to provide an overview of recent work examining the normal human choroid, its changes with myopia and the possible role of the choroid in the mechanism regulating eye growth. Studies have demonstrated that choroidal thinning accompanies the development and progression of myopia, and have established a close link between eye growth and choroidal thickness changes. Dramatic thinning of the choroid is seen with high myopia, and associations are also observed between choroidal thinning and reduced vision, and the development of retinal pathology associated with high myopia. In the short-term, environmental factors known to be associated with myopia development and more rapid eye growth typically lead to a thinning of the choroid, whereas factors linked to a slowing of eye growth are typically associated with short-term choroidal thickening. Collectively, these findings suggest that the choroid is an important biomarker of eye growth in the human eye, and additional research to better understand the human choroid is likely to further our knowledge of the signals and pathways regulating eye growth, myopia development and progression."

Antipsychotics are thought to be effective in the treatment of hiccups; however, they have rarely been reported to induce hiccups. Within 24 hours of taking aripiprazole, the patient began having hiccups continuously. One week after the hiccups ceased, the patient resumed taking aripiprazole, and the hiccups began again. Although rare, this case study suggests that aripiprazole induces hiccups."

Numerous reports of oral, intravenous and intraarticular corticosteroids inducing hiccups exist in the literature. To date, there is only one case of anabolic steroids inducing hiccups. We now present a case of a patient who underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for resection of a cerebellar pontine angle meningioma. Postoperatively the patient was on high doses of Decadron and Oxandrin, an anabolic-anticatabolic agent used to combat the deleterious effects of corticosteroids. The patient suffered intractable hiccups postoperative day one, resistant to Thorazine. Oxandrin was discontinued to assess the possibility of a anabolic steroid-induced singultus. The hiccups resolved within 24 hours. This report validates the previous report on anabolic steroids inducing hiccups and exemplifies the ability for steroids as a class, due to there backbone structural homology, to induce function even as competitive inhibitors."

Hiccups occurred 2 hours after intravenous injection of moxifloxacin and lasted into evening. On the second day after injection, hiccups occurred again and made it difficult for him to fall asleep. The clinician ruled out gastrointestinal disease, nervous system disease, electrolyte disturbance and other factors. On assessing causality of the adverse drug reaction, the Naranjo scale for moxifloxacin was six, indicating a probable relationship of hiccups with moxifloxacin.

A 76-year-old man presented with persistent hiccups after beginning azithromycin for the treatment of pharyngitis. Hiccups were persistent and exhausting. Discontinuation of azithromycin and therapy with baclofen finally resolved hiccups. No organic cause of hiccups was identified despite extensive investigation. Pharmacotherapeutic agents have been uncommonly associated with hiccups. Corticosteroids (dexamethasone and methylprednisolone), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and general anaesthesia have been the specific agents mentioned most frequently in the literature as being associated with the development of hiccups. Few cases of drug-induced hiccups have been reported related to macrolide antimicrobials. Using the Naranjo adverse effect reaction probability scale this event could be classified as possible (score 5 points), mostly because of the close temporal sequence, previous reports on this reaction with other macrolides and the absence of any alternative explanation for hiccups. Our hypothesis is that a vagal mechanism mediated by azithromycin could be the pathogenesis of hiccups in our patient. Diagnosis of drug-induced hiccups is difficult and often achieved only by a process of elimination. However, macrolide antimicrobials have been reported to be associated with hiccups and vagal mechanism could explain the development of this side-effect."

There is a recent report of progesterone-induced hiccups, which were thought to occur secondary to the glucocorticoid-like effects of progesterone on the brainstem. We report the first case of anabolic steroid-induced hiccups occurring in an elite power lifter. The hiccups occurred within 12 hours of the individual increasing his doses of oral anabolic steroids and persisted for 12 consecutive hours until medical attention was sought.

This study adopted a retrospective case control design. The study subjects were 168 cancer patients admitted to a university hospital for chemotherapy between October 2011 and December 2016: 58 patients who experienced intractable hiccups while on dexamethasone (cases) and 110 matched patients who received dexamethasone but did not experience hiccups (controls). Data were collected from most recent medical records and included demographic, health- and cancer-related, and physiological factors. Our findings demonstrated that the development of dexamethasone-induced hiccups was significantly associated with a male gender, a young age, overweight/obesity, the use of alkylating anticancer agents (particularly as the first anticancer drug), high levels of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, uric acid, and albumin, and an elevated body temperature. Oncology nurses should be aware of influencing factors of dexamethasone-induced hiccups in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Our findings may provide evidence to design oncology nursing strategies that help maximize the benefits of chemotherapy in cancer patients."

          "abstract": "Hiccups are occasionally experienced by most individuals. Although hiccups are not life-threatening, they may lead to a decline in quality of life. Previous studies showed that hiccups may occur as an adverse effect of certain medicines during chemotherapy. Furthermore, a male dominance in hiccups has been reported. However, due to the limited number of studies conducted on this phenomenon, debate still surrounds the few factors influencing hiccups. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of medicines and patient characteristics on hiccups using a large-sized adverse drug event report database and, specifically, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Cases of adverse effects associated with medications were extracted from JADER, and Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the presence or absence of hiccups for each medication. In a multivariate analysis, we conducted a multiple logistic regression analysis using medication and patient characteristic variables exhibiting significance. We also examined the role of dexamethasone in inducing hiccups during chemotherapy. Medicines associated with hiccups included dexamethasone, levofolinate, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, and irinotecan. Patient characteristics associated with hiccups included a male gender and greater height. The combination of anti-cancer agent and dexamethasone use was noted in more than 95% of patients in the dexamethasone-use group. Hiccups also occurred in patients in the anti-cancer agent-use group who did not use dexamethasone. Most of the medications that induce hiccups are used in chemotherapy. The results of the present study suggest that it is possible to predict a high risk of hiccups using patient characteristics. We confirmed that dexamethasone was the drug that has the strongest influence on the induction of hiccups. However, the influence of anti-cancer agents on the induction of hiccups cannot be denied. We consider the results of the present study to be helpful for the prevention and treatment of hiccups."

The aims of this study were to investigate the feasibility of methylprednisolone rotation as treatment and to confirm the male predominance among those with cancer who experienced DIH during chemotherapy. Methods. Persons with cancer who experienced hiccups during chemotherapy treatment and who were receiving treatment with dexamethasone were presumed to have DIH. The following algorithmic practice was implemented for antiemetic corticosteroid use: rotation from dexamethasone to methylprednisolone in the next cycle and dexamethasone re-administration in the second cycle of chemotherapy after recognition of hiccups to confirm DIH. All other antiemetics except corticosteroid remained unchanged. Patients (n = 40) were recruited from eight cancer centers in Korea from September 2012 to April 2013. Data were collected retrospectively. Results. Hiccup intensity (numeric rating scale [NRS]: 5.38 vs. 0.53) and duration (68.44 minutes vs. 1.79 minutes) were significantly decreased after rotation to methylprednisolone, while intensity of emesis was not increased (NRS: 2.63 vs. 2.08). Median dose of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone were 10 mg and 50 mg, respectively. Thirty-four (85%) of 40 patients showed complete resolution of hiccups after methylprednisolone rotation in the next cycle. Of these 34 patients, 25 (73.5%) had recurrence of hiccups after dexamethasone re-administration. Compared with baseline values, hiccup intensity (NRS: 5.24 vs. 2.44) and duration (66.43 minutes vs. 22.00 minutes) were significantly attenuated after dexamethasone re-administration. Of the 40 eligible patients, 38 (95%) were male. Conclusion. DIH during chemotherapy could be controlled without losing antiemetic potential by replacing dexamethasone with methylprednisolone. We also identified a male predominance of DIH. Further prospective studies are warranted."

By detection of binding for three different antivenoms and performing an alanine scan, linear elements of epitopes and the positions important for binding were identified. A strong tendency of antivenom antibodies recognizing and binding to epitopes at the functional sites of toxins was observed. With these results, high-density peptide microarray technology is for the first time introduced in the field of toxinology and molecular details of the evolution of antibody-toxin interactions based on molecular recognition of distinctive toxic motifs are elucidated."

Crude venom was injected into the Sephadex G50 filtration gel chromatography column and then toxic fractions were obtained. Then the corresponding fraction was injected into the HPLC column and the toxic peaks were identified. N. naja oxiana venom was injected into a camel and specific nanobodies screening was performed against the toxic peak using phage display technique. The obtained results showed that among the 12 clones obtained, N24 nanobody was capable of neutralizing P1, the most toxic peak obtained from HPLC chromatography. The molecular weight of P1 was measured with a mass spectrometer and was found to be about seven kDa. The results of the neutralization test of crude N. naja oxiana venom with N24 nanobody showed that 250 μg of recombinant nanobody could neutralize the toxic effects of 20 μg equivalent to LD<sub>50</sub> × 10 of crude venom in mice.

          "abstract": "Snake venom is a potentially lethal and complex mixture of hundreds of functionally diverse proteins that are difficult to purify and hence difficult to characterize. These difficulties have inhibited the development of toxin-targeted therapy, and conventional antivenom is still generated from the sera of horses or sheep immunized with whole venom. Although life-saving, antivenoms contain an immunoglobulin pool of unknown antigen specificity and known redundancy, which necessitates the delivery of large volumes of heterologous immunoglobulin to the envenomed victim, thus increasing the risk of anaphylactoid and serum sickness adverse effects. Here we exploit recent molecular sequence analysis and DNA immunization tools to design more rational toxin-targeted antivenom. We developed a novel bioinformatic strategy that identified sequences encoding immunogenic and structurally significant epitopes from an expressed sequence tag database of a venom gland cDNA library of Echis ocellatus, the most medically important viper in Africa. Focusing upon snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) that are responsible for the severe and frequently lethal hemorrhage in envenomed victims, we identified seven epitopes that we predicted would be represented in all isomers of this multimeric toxin and that we engineered into a single synthetic multiepitope DNA immunogen (epitope string). We compared the specificity and toxin-neutralizing efficacy of antiserum raised against the string to antisera raised against a single SVMP toxin (or domains) or antiserum raised by conventional (whole venom) immunization protocols. The SVMP string antiserum, as predicted in silico, contained antibody specificities to numerous SVMPs in E. ocellatus venom and venoms of several other African vipers. More significantly, the antiserum cross-specifically neutralized hemorrhage induced by E. ocellatus and Cerastes cerastes cerastes venoms. These data provide valuable sequence and structure/function information of viper venom hemorrhagins but, more importantly, a new opportunity to design toxin-specific antivenoms-the first major conceptual change in antivenom design after more than a century of production. Furthermore, this approach may be adapted to immunotherapy design in other cases where targets are numerous, diverse, and poorly characterized such as those generated by hypermutation or antigenic variation."

Despite their value, antivenoms present risks of adverse reactions. Current formulations contain a fraction of nonspecific antibodies and serum proteins. While new promising candidates emerge as the next generation of antivenoms, it remains clear that animal-derived antivenoms will still play a critical role for years to come. In this study, we improved the bothropic antivenom (BAv), by capturing toxin-specific antibodies through affinity chromatography using immobilized <i>Bothrops jararaca</i> venom toxins. This process produced an improved antivenom (iBAv) enriched in neutralizing antibodies and depleted of serum proteins. Proteomic analysis showed that iBAv was 87% depleted in albumin and 37-83% lower in other serum proteins compared to BAv. Functional evaluation demonstrated that iBAv had a 2.9-fold higher affinity for venom toxins by surface plasmon resonance and a 2.8-fold lower ED50 <i>in vivo</i>, indicating enhanced potency. Our findings indicate that enriching specific antibodies while depleting serum proteins reduces the total protein dose required and increases the potency of antivenom. Although technical and economic considerations remain for large-scale implementation, this affinity-enriched antivenom represents a significant advancement in improving antivenom efficacy against <i>B. jararaca</i> envenomations."

We report anti-3FTxs monoclonal antibodies developed against N. ashei venom in mice. All the three test mAbs (P4G6a, P6D9a, and P6D9b) were found to be IgG antibodies, isotyped as IgG1. SDS-PAGE analysis of the test mAbs showed two major bands at approximately 55 and 29 kDa, suggestive of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain composition, respectively. The immunoaffinity-purified test mAbs demonstrated higher binding efficacy to the target antigen compared to negative control. Similarly, a cocktail of the test mAbs was found to induce a significantly higher inhibition (p-value < 0.0001) compared to two leading commercial brands of antivenoms on the Kenyan market, implying a higher specificity for the target antigen. Both the test mAbs and 3FTxs polyclonal antibodies induced comparable inhibition (p-value = 0.9029). The inhibition induced by the 3FTxs polyclonal antibodies was significantly different from the two antivenoms (p-value < 0.0001).

          "abstract": "Snakebite is a major public health issue in the rural tropics. Antivenom is the only specific treatment currently available. We review the history, mechanism of action and current developments in snake antivenoms. In the late nineteenth century, snake antivenoms were first developed by raising hyperimmune serum in animals, such as horses, against snake venoms. Hyperimmune serum was then purified to produce whole immunoglobulin G (IgG) antivenoms. IgG was then fractionated to produce F(ab) and F(ab')2 antivenoms to reduce adverse reactions and increase efficacy. Current commercial antivenoms are polyclonal mixtures of antibodies or their fractions raised against all toxin antigens in a venom(s), irrespective of clinical importance. Over the last few decades there have been small incremental improvements in antivenoms, to make them safer and more effective. A number of recent developments in biotechnology and toxinology have contributed to this. Proteomics and transcriptomics have been applied to venom toxin composition (venomics), improving our understanding of medically important toxins. In addition, it has become possible to identify toxins that contain epitopes recognized by antivenom molecules (antivenomics). Integration of the toxinological profile of a venom and its composition to identify medically relevant toxins improved this. Furthermore, camelid, humanized and fully human monoclonal antibodies and their fractions, as well as enzyme inhibitors have been experimentally developed against venom toxins. Translation of such technology into commercial antivenoms requires overcoming the high costs, limited knowledge of venom and antivenom pharmacology, and lack of reliable animal models. Addressing such should be the focus of antivenom research."

The focus in the Indian subcontinent is usually on the Indian cobra (Naja naja), common krait (Bungarus caeruleus), Russell's viper (Daboia russelii), and Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus). The Indian polyvalent antivenom contains hyperimmunized horse antibodies against only these 4 species. However, regional intraspecific variations are important in viper envenomings, leading to marked differences in clinical presentation and response to the available polyvalent antivenom. Echis carinatus sochureki, a subspecies of Echis carinatus, has been linked to serious morbidity in the Thar Desert regions of Rajasthan, although consistent reports are lacking. We report a patient with prolonged venom-induced consumption coagulopathy owing to Echis carinatus sochureki envenoming who did not respond to Indian polyvalent antivenom in Jodhpur, India. Features of local and hemotoxic envenoming resolved after a week with supportive care. Echis sochureki venom has been shown to be different from Echis carinatus in terms of composition and in vitro neutralization by antivenom. Clinicians in the tropical desert regions must suspect Echis sochureki envenoming in the setting of nonresponsiveness to Indian polyvalent antivenom. This will help optimize antivenom use in these patients, preventing potentially life-threatening antivenom associated reactions. Because the usefulness of Indian polyvalent antivenom appears to be limited in this setting, there is an urgent need to advocate for region-specific antivenom or monovalent antivenom for this area."

The recommended treatment is the use of antivenom, which is composed of immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments obtained from the plasma of animals hyperimmunized with one (monospecific) or several (polyspecific) venoms. In this review, the efforts made in the improvement of the already available antivenoms and the development of new antivenoms, focusing on snakes of medical importance from sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, are described. Some antivenoms currently used are composed of whole IgGs, whereas others use F(ab')2 fragments. The classic methods of attaining snake antivenoms are presented, in addition to new strategies to improve their effectiveness. Punctual changes in immunization protocols, in addition to the use of cross-reactivity between venoms from different snakes for the manufacture of more potent and widely used antivenoms, are presented. It is known that venoms are a complex mixture of components; however, advances in the field of antivenoms have shown that there are key toxins that, if effectively blocked, are capable of reversing the condition of in vivo envenomation. These studies provide an opportunity for the use of monoclonal antibodies in the development of new-generation antivenoms. Thus, monoclonal antibodies and their fragments are described as a possible alternative for the production of antivenoms, regardless of the venom. This review also highlights the challenges associated with their development."

Two alternative hypotheses were postulated recently: (a) microglia differ from peripheral macrophages being derived from the yolk sac (YS), whereas peripheral macrophages originate from bone marrow (BM); (b) microglia acquire a specific phenotype under the influence of the CNS microenvironment. We have previously shown that microglia express miR-124, which was also induced in BM-derived macrophages co-cultured with a neurons. We here investigated the possibility of horizontal transfer of the neuron-specific microRNAs miR-124 and miR-9 from primary neurons to microglia/macrophages. We found that after incubation with neuronal conditioned media (NCM), macrophages downregulated activation markers MHC class II and CD45. Neither cultured adult microglia nor YS- and BM-derived macrophages demonstrated intrinsic levels of miR-124 expression. However, after incubation with NCM, miR-124 was induced in both YS- and BM-derived macrophages. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that the NCM contained miR-124 and miR-9 in complex with small proteins, large high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and exosomes. MiR-124 and miR-9 were promptly released from neurons, and this process was inhibited by tetrodotoxin, indicating an important role of neuronal electric activity in secretion of these microRNAs. Incubation of macrophages with exogenous miR-124 resulted in efficient translocation of miR-124 into the cytoplasm. This study demonstrates an important role of neuronal miRNAs in communication of neurons with microglia, which favors the hypothesis that microglia acquire a specific phenotype under the influence of the CNS microenvironment."

          "abstract": "Activated microglial cells and peripheral macrophages are hardly distinguishable from the viewpoints of morphology and function. There are various immunological markers common to both microglial cells and peripheral macrophages. In the present study, however, we found that microglial cells have distinct characters in terms of adhesion and morphology. By using a \"rheoscope,\" that is an apparatus to rheologically measure the strength of cell adhesion to substrates, rat microglial cells were found to attach to polystyrene dishes much more weakly than alveolar and peritoneal macrophages. Interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) strengthened the adhesion of alveolar and peritoneal macrophages, whereas it weakened that of microglial cells. Morphological changes of microglial cells induced by IFNgamma were also different from those of peripheral macrophages. Furthermore, alveolar and peritoneal macrophages produced NO in response to IFNgamma, while microglial cells did not. When cultured on astrocyte-derived extracellular matrix (AsECM) in serum-free medium, only microglial cells extended multiple ramified processes. Conversely, alveolar and peritoneal macrophages on AsECM shrunk their ruffling membrane and rounded up. These distinctions between microglial cells and macrophages may reflect differences in cell lineages as well as environments in which individual cells reside."

          "abstract": "Differently from other myeloid cells, microglia derive exclusively from precursors originating within the yolk sac and migrate to the CNS under development, without any contribution from fetal liver or postnatal hematopoiesis. Consistent with their unique ontology, microglia may express specific physiological markers, which have been partly described in recent years. Here we wondered whether profiles distinguishing microglia from peripheral macrophages vary with age and under pathology. To this goal, we profiled transcriptomes of microglia throughout the lifespan and included a parallel comparison with peripheral macrophages under physiological and neuroinflammatory settings using age- and sex-matched wild-type and bone marrow chimera mouse models. This comprehensive approach demonstrated that the phenotypic differentiation between microglia and peripheral macrophages is age-dependent and that peripheral macrophages do express some of the most commonly described microglia-specific markers early during development, such as Fcrls, P2ry12, Tmem119, and Trem2. Further, during chronic neuroinflammation CNS-infiltrating macrophages and not peripheral myeloid cells acquire microglial markers, indicating that the CNS niche may instruct peripheral myeloid cells to gain the phenotype and, presumably, the function of the microglia cell. In conclusion, our data provide further evidence about the plasticity of the myeloid cell and suggest caution in the strict definition and application of microglia-specific markers.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Understanding the respective role of microglia and infiltrating monocytes in neuroinflammatory conditions has recently seemed possible by the identification of a specific microglia signature. Here instead we provide evidence that peripheral macrophages may express some of the most commonly described microglia markers at some developmental stages or pathological conditions, in particular during chronic neuroinflammation. Further, our data support the hypothesis about phenotypic plasticity and convergence among distinct myeloid cells so that they may act as a functional unit rather than as different entities, boosting their mutual functions in different phases of disease. This holds relevant implications in the view of the growing use of myeloid cell therapies to treat brain disease in humans."

          "abstract": "Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), can be distinguished from most other cells of the myelomonocytic lineage by a distinct pattern of membrane currents. In the accompanying paper we have shown that the characteristic morphological feature of microglia, ramification, develops both in microglia and other myelomonocytic cells when they are cocultured with astrocytes. We therefore propose that the electrophysiological properties of microglia also develop under the influence of astrocytes, and, moreover, that these properties can also be induced in other cells of the myelomonocytic lineage. Microglia cultured on poly-d-lysine or on a monolayer of fibroblasts possess an inwardly rectifying K(+)-current only, which is of composite nature. In single-channel recordings two types of K(+)-channels are found: i) a noninactivating channel with a conductance of 43pS, and ii) an inactivating channel with 32pS. Microglia cultured on a monolayer of astrocytes additionally develop an outward K(+)-current and a Na(+)-current. The electric parameters of activation and inactivation of the microglial Na(+)-current are identical to those of the neuronal Na(+)-current. Monocytes from peripheral blood and macrophages from spleen exhibit no inward currents. However, when these cells are cocultured with astrocytes they develop microglia-like membrane currents, including the inward and outward K(+)-rectifyer and the Na(+)-current. By contrast, on fibroblasts they retain their macrophage current profile. The expression of the microglia-like membrane currents in the mononuclear phagocytes is induced by a diffusible factor released from the astrocytes into the culture medium, since monocytes and microglia develop the mature microglial current profile, when cultured in astrocyte conditioned medium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

          "abstract": "Several morphological and functional properties of microglial cells, the resident immunoeffector cells of the central nervous system (CNS), differ from those of monocytes/macrophages in other tissues. Microglia are assumed to derive from myelonocytic lineage, possibly as a distinct subpopulation that diverges from a common cell line early in ontogeny, invades the CNS, proliferates, and differentiates into ameboid and then ramified microglia. We tested the hypothesis that some morphological and functional properties of microglia are induced in myelomonocytic cells by nervous tissue, specifically astrocytes. In the present in vitro studies we compared the differentiation of microglia, blood monocytes, and spleen macrophages on acellular substrates and on monolayers of astrocytes and fibroblasts. On acellular substrates, microglial cells at first acquire an ameboid morphology; later they show a few short, unbranched processes. On monolayers of pure astrocytes, microglial cells at first also differentiate into ameboid cells, but after 5 to 7 days they start to develop processes with large lamellopodial tips. These lengthen and branch continuously during the next 2 weeks in vitro, demarcating a round to oval territory around the small ellipsoid cell body. By contrast, on monolayers of fibroblasts the microglial cells develop an ameboid morphology, but do not grow the typical long branched processes of the ramified form. Blood monocytes and spleen macrophages behave indistinguishably from microglia both on acellular and cellular substrates, i.e., on astroglia they develop the ramified form, while on fibroblasts they retain the ameboid shape. When microglia, macrophages, or monocytes are cultured on coverslips on top of astrocytic monolayers, i.e., physically separated from the astroglia, but exposed to the medium conditioned by astrocytes, a significant proportion of them also develop the ramified shape. These findings indicate that the ramified shape of microglia is induced by astrocytes. Since this morphology can also be induced in blood monocytes and macrophages, we take this to be further evidence for the proposition that microglial cells are derived from the myelomonocytic lineage, and, moreover, that properties of resident macrophages are largely determined by tissue components of their host organ."

Most CNS macrophages emerge during development, with the exception of choroid plexus and dural macrophages, which are replaced by monocytes in adulthood. Whether microglia and BAMs share a developmental program or arise from separate lineages remains unknown. Here, we identified two phenotypically, transcriptionally, and locally distinct brain macrophages throughout development, giving rise to either microglia or BAMs. Two macrophage populations were already present in the yolk sac suggesting an early segregation. Fate-mapping models revealed that BAMs mostly derived from early erythro-myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac. The development of microglia was dependent on TGF-β, whereas the genesis of BAMs occurred independently of this cytokine. Collectively, our data show that developing parenchymal and non-parenchymal brain macrophages are separate entities in terms of ontogeny, gene signature, and requirement for TGF-β."

          "abstract": "Macrophages in the injured spinal cord arise from resident microglia and infiltrating, peripherally derived monocytes. It is still not clear if macrophages derived from these two populations differ in their roles after CNS injury. The aims of this study are to investigate the phagocytic response and clearance of damaged axons and tissue debris by these distinct subsets of macrophages and assess their viability after spinal cord injury (SCI). The lysozyme M EGFP-knockin mouse tags hematogenous macrophages, but not microglia. Using a combination of immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and neuronal tracing techniques, we show that microglia contact damaged axons early (24 h) after SCI and are the main type of macrophage to contain phagocytic material at 3 d. Thereafter, infiltrating macrophages become the predominant cell in contact with degenerating axons and contain more phagocytic material, which in contrast to microglia, persists for up to 42 d. Furthermore, after phagocytosis of myelin in vitro, bone marrow-derived macrophages are much more susceptible to apoptotic and necrotic cell death than CNS microglia, which is mirrored in vivo with apoptotic TUNEL-positive cells of infiltrating macrophage origin. This work suggests that microglia play a major role in the early response to SCI, by phagocytosing damaged and degenerating tissue, processing phagocytic material efficiently, and remaining viable. Later, macrophages of peripheral origin contribute predominantly to phagocytosis but are less efficient at processing CNS debris, and their death, in situ, may contribute to the secondary damage after CNS injury."

After different conditioning paradigms and bone marrow (BM) or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation, graft-derived cells seed the brain and persistently contribute to the parenchymal brain macrophage compartment. Here we establish that graft-derived macrophages acquire, over time, microglia characteristics, including ramified morphology, longevity, radio-resistance and clonal expansion. However, even after prolonged CNS residence, transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility landscapes of engrafted, BM-derived macrophages remain distinct from yolk sac-derived host microglia. Furthermore, engrafted BM-derived cells display discrete responses to peripheral endotoxin challenge, as compared to host microglia. In human HSC transplant recipients, engrafted cells also remain distinct from host microglia, extending our finding to clinical settings. Collectively, our data emphasize the molecular and functional heterogeneity of parenchymal brain macrophages and highlight potential clinical implications for HSC gene therapies aimed to ameliorate lysosomal storage disorders, microgliopathies or general monogenic immuno-deficiencies."

Real-time changes to the stimulation parameters such as period, amplitude and pulse width were applied using a graphical user interface, which communicated with the microcontroller to deliver the stimulus. The new pacemaker allows the voltage, delivered current and resistance between pacing electrodes to be continuously monitored.

The pattern of pacesetter potenitals in patients with gastric ulcer, gastric cancer, and duodenal ulcer was similar to that of patients without such diseases. Complete transection of the gastric corpus isolated the distal stomach from the natural pacemaker and resulted in the appearance of a new pacemaker in the distal stomach with a slower frequency. The fact that proximal gastric vagotomy did not greatly alter the frequency of generation or the pattern of propagation of the pacesetter potential provided further evidence that both are myogenic phenomena."

Intrinsic, myogenic, electrical slow waves, the principal regulators of motility in the mammalian gut, have not been found in the avian gut. Instead, contractions appear to be initiated by a neurogenic pacemaker located between the gastric isthmus and the pylorus. Pacemaker impulses travel over the myenteric plexus to the glandular stomach and the duodenum, and to the muscles of the muscular stomach to initiate contractions. Extrinsic innervation does not appear to be involved in this initiation. The role of two hormones, avian pancreatic polypeptide (aPP) and cholecystokinin (CCK), in regulation of gastric motility has been examined. Both hormones are released postprandially by the presence of ingesta in the upper small intestine and both depress gastroduodenal motility when administered to fowl. Thus, aPP and CCK slow gastric emptying to allow more time for intestinal digestion."

New flexible surface-contact pacing electrodes (SPE) that can be placed atraumatically to pace and simultaneously map the slow-wave activity in the surrounding area were developed. SPE were applied in pigs in-vivo for gastric pacing along with concurrent high-resolution slow wave mapping as validation. Histology was conducted to assess for tissue damage around the pacing site. SPE were compared against temporary cardiac pacing electrodes (CPE), and hook-shaped pacing electrodes (HPE), for entrainment rate, entrainment threshold, contact quality, and slow-wave propagation patterns. Pacing with SPE (amplitude: 2 mA, pulse width: 100 ms) consistently achieved pacemaker initiation. Histological analysis illustrated no significant tissue damage. SPE resulted in a higher rate of entrainment (64%) than CPE (37%) and HPE (24%), with lower entrainment threshold (25% of CPE and 16% of HPE). High resolution mapping showed that there was no significant difference between the initiated slow-wave propagation speed for SPE and CPE (6.8 ± 0.1 vs 6.8 ± 0.2 mm/s, P>0.05). However, SPE had higher loss of tissue lead contact quality than CPE (42 ± 16 vs 13 ± 10% over 20 min). Pacing with SPE induced a slow-wave pacemaker site without tissue damage.

In vivo high-resolution serosal electrical mapping (16 × 16 electrodes; 6 × 6 cm) was applied to localize normal and ectopic gastric pacemaker sites in 13 anesthetized pigs. Radiofrequency ablation was performed in a square formation surrounding the pacemaker site. Postablation high-resolution mapping revealed that ablation successfully induced localized conduction blocks after 18 min (SD 5). Normal gastric pacemaker sites were eliminated by ablation (<i>n</i> = 6), resulting in the emergence of a new pacemaker site immediately distal to the original site in all cases. Ectopic pacemaker sites were similarly eliminated by ablation in all cases (<i>n</i> = 7), and the surrounding mapped area was then entrained by normal antegrade activity in five of those cases.

Physiological activity of the gastric remnant was assessed in terms of electrical as well as peristaltic functions by means of electrogastrography and video-recorded barium swallow study. Electrical and mechanical pacing activities were classified into normogastria or dysrhythmia (brady- or tachygastria) according to their frequencies. In these patients, ectopic pacemakers were found to be arising just distal to the site of resection along the greater curve. Electrophysiologically, one patient was diagnosed as having normogastria, and other 3 patients were found to have dysrhythmia (2, bradygastria; 1, tachygastria) on the basis of electrogastrographic analyses. In two of three patients studied further by fluoroscopy, electrical activity agreed well with peristaltic activity. In one patient, however, electrical tachygastria was associated with peristaltic bradygastria. In conclusion, an ectopic pacemaker arises in the stomach that does not remain silent after neonatal surgical loss of its own pacemaker.

The absence of the disorder in the parents of three affected siblings can be explained by autosomal recessive inheritance, autosomal dominant inheritance or germ-line mosaicism. Each affected member showed iris stroma hypoplasia, miotic pupils and defects of the iris pigment epithelium. Less frequently encountered features included increased axial length, high myopia and congenital cataract. Most of the abnormalities can be accounted for by a disturbance in the growth and development of neural crest cells of the anterior chamber angle."

The corneal specimen of a 4-month-old infant with newborn primary congenital glaucoma and cloudy corneas who had undergone penetrating keratoplasty was evaluated by light and electron microscopy. Light microscopy showed a thinned epithelium, areas of thickened Bowman's layer (approximately 27 mum thick) interspersed with nuclei, and a thickened and disorganized stroma. Descemet's membrane was intact, and the endothelium was mildly attenuated. The corneal changes seen in this patient may be specific to primary congenital glaucoma and may contribute to the corneal clouding seen so frequently in these patients."

          "abstract": "Glaucoma is the second most prominent cause of impaired vision in the world. Over 60 million individuals are presently affected, and 12 million are sightless as a result. Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a childhood disease that can lead to blindness in newborns and very young children. The rate of occurrence of PCG varies in different communities and across geographical boundaries, and its etiology is unknown. It is caused by genetic structural defects in the trabecular meshwork and makes its appearence in newborns and children no older than three years. PCG is most prevalent in populations with high rates of consanguineous marriages. It is categorized by inappropriate development of the eye's aqueous outflow system, causing increased intraocular pressure (IOP) and leading to swelling of the cornea, epiphora, discomfort or pain, enlargement of the eyeball (buphthalmos), corneal opacity, and optic nerve damage. PCG is classified as an autosomal recessive disorder involving four loci. The main culprit is CYP1B1, at locus GLC3A. PCG is also linked with loci GLC3B and GLC3C; however, their genetic factors have only recently been recognized. The gene LTPB2 at locus GLC3D, plays an important role in tissue healing and cell attachment. Trabeculectomy and gonioscopy are effective treatments for PCG. Additional efforts are essential to provide timely screening of children and, most important, to assign sufficient resources to allow healthcare workers to reduce the rate of avoidable blindness in developing countries."

          "abstract": "Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) is a rare genetic disease usually diagnosed during the first year of life. It occurs because of developmental anomalies of the chamber angle that prevents drainage of aqueous humor, thereby elevating intraocular pressure. Its incidence is 1 in 10,000 live newborns in Western societies and 1 in 1,200 live newborns in the Arab-Bedouin population of the Negev region in Israel. Most cases of PCG appear to be sporadic. The cytochrome P4501B1 gene located within the GLC3A locus on chromosome 2p21 is mutated in individuals with PCG. The triad of epiphora, photophobia, and blepharospasm is classical for PCG. General anesthesia is usually required for an adequate examination of intraocular pressure, corneal diameter, optic disc, and axial length in young children. Congenital glaucoma is almost always managed surgically, with medical therapy being used only as a temporizing measure before surgery or when surgical intervention has repeatedly failed. At least 50% of eyes with PCG presenting at birth will become legally blind (visual acuity < 6/60). Patients with PCG require follow-up examinations throughout their lives."

Still, only a subset of patients shows a good response to any single therapy. Moreover, it remains largely unsolved how we can maintain durable clinical responses, or how we can successfully treat a broader range of cancers by immunotherapy. Growing evidence suggests that the major barrier to more successful cancer immunotherapy is the tumour microenvironment (TME), where chronic inflammation has a predominant role in tumour survival and proliferation, angiogenesis and immunosuppression. Over the past decades, our understanding of cancer-related inflammation has significantly evolved, and now we have various therapeutic options tailored to the TME. These therapeutic strategies include inhibiting inflammatory mediators or their downstream signalling molecules, blocking the recruitment of myeloid cells, modulating immunosuppressive functions in myeloid cells and re-educating the TME. In this review, we discuss the role of cancer-related inflammation as a potential target in the era of immunotherapy."

This study was conducted in a referral tertiary care university hospital with a cardiovascular focus. A total of 311 consecutive adult patients undergoing any type of cardiac surgery were evaluated. The subjects were examined at regular intervals in the postoperative period using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) tool. The incidence of postoperative delirium (PD) was 10%. Among the 18 pre-, intra- and postoperative variables evaluated, the logistic regression analysis showed that low education level, history of diabetes or stroke, type of surgery, prolonged extracorporeal circulation, or red blood cell transfusion in the intra- or postoperative period were independently associated with delirium after cardiac surgery. An increased body mass index was identified as a protective factor. The aforementioned risk factors are significantly and independently associated with the presentation of PD. Because some of these factors can be treated or avoided, the results of this study are highly relevant to reduce the risk of this complication and improve the care of patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

Although various risk factors for postoperative delirium have been identified, the relationship between nocturnal breathing disorders and delirium has not yet been elucidated. This study evaluated the relationship between sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and postoperative delirium in cardiac surgery patients without a previous diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. In this prospective cohort study, 92 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with extracorporeal circulation were evaluated for both SDB and postoperative delirium. Polygraphic recordings were used to calculate the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI; mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour recorded) of all patients preoperatively. Delirium was assessed during the first four postoperative days using the Confusion Assessment Method. Clinical differences between individuals with and without postoperative delirium were determined with univariate analysis. The relationship between postoperative delirium and those covariates that were associated with delirium in univariate analysis was determined by a multivariate logistic regression model. The median overall preoperative AHI was 18.3 (interquartile range, 8.7 to 32.8). Delirium was diagnosed in 44 patients. The median AHI differed significantly between patients with and without postoperative delirium (28 versus 13; P = 0.001). A preoperative AHI of 19 or higher was associated with an almost sixfold increased risk of postoperative delirium (odds ratio, 6.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 15.4; P <0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that preoperative AHI, age, smoking, and blood transfusion were independently associated with postoperative delirium. Preoperative SDB (for example, undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea) were strongly associated with postoperative delirium, and may be a risk factor for postoperative delirium."

This prospective observational trial examined the predictive value of MCA MFV and rSO<sub>2</sub>, measured immediately before induction of anesthesia, for delirium after valvular heart surgery in elderly patients. In 113 patients, delirium was evaluated for 7 days postoperatively, using the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative delirium. Overall, 16 patients (14%) exhibited delirium. MCA MVF values could not predict the development of delirium. Preoperative statin use, geriatric depression scale score, and low preoperative rSO<sub>2</sub> (< 60%) showed association with delirium occurrence in univariable analysis. After multivariable analysis, only the low preoperative rSO<sub>2</sub> (< 60%) (OR 6.748, 95% CI 1.647-27.652, P = 0.008) remained as an independent predictor of delirium.

We aimed to determine the incidence, predisposing and triggering factors of delirium following cardiac surgery. One hundred seventy-three consecutive patients aged ≥60 years were studied. Patients' characteristics and two cognitive function assessment tests were recorded preoperatively. Perioperative variables were blood transfusion, orotracheal intubation time (OIT), renal dysfunction, and hypoxemia. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. The composite outcome consisted of death, infection, and perioperative myocardial infarction until hospital discharge or 30 days after surgery, and for up to 18 months. One hundred six patients (61.27%) were men and the age was 69.5 ± 5.8 years. EuroSCORE II index was 4.06 ± 3.86. Hypertension was present in 75.14%, diabetes in 39.88%, and 30.06% were illiterate. Delirium occurred in 59 patients (34.1%). Education level (OR 0.81, 0.71-0.92), hypertension (OR 2.73, 1.16-6.40), and mitral valve disease (OR 2.93, 1.32-6.50) were independent predisposing factors for delirium, and atrial fibrillation after surgery (OR 2.49, 1.20-5.20) represented the potential triggering factor. Delirium (OR 2.35, 1.20-4.58) and OIT ≥ 900 min (OR 2.50; 1.30-4.80) were independently associated with the composite outcome.

In this single-center substudy of the BAG-RECALL trial (NCT00682825), we screened patients after cardiac or thoracic surgery in the ICU twice daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of delirium in patients who had been randomized to intraoperative Bispectral Index (BIS)-guided and end-tidal anesthetic concentration-guided depth of anesthesia protocols. As a secondary analysis, a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection strategy was used to rank a field of candidate risk factors for delirium, followed by binary logistic regression. Of 310 patients assessed, 28 of 149 (18.8%) in the BIS group and 45 of 161 (28.0%) in the end-tidal anesthetic concentration group developed postoperative delirium in the ICU (odds ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval, 0.35-1.02, P= 0.058). Low average volatile anesthetic dose, intraoperative transfusion, ASA physical status, and European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation were identified as independent predictors of delirium. A larger randomized study should determine whether brain monitoring with BIS or an alternative method decreases delirium after cardiac or thoracic surgery. The association between low anesthetic concentration and delirium is a surprising finding and could reflect that patients with poor health are both more sensitive to the effects of volatile anesthetic drugs and are also more likely to develop postoperative delirium. Investigation of candidate methods to prevent delirium should be prioritized in view of the established association between postoperative delirium and adverse patient outcomes."

The development of postoperative delirium (POD) is associated with increased hospital stay lengths, morbidity, the need for home care, and mortality. Studies have appeared in the last decade that evaluate the use of noninvasive monitoring to prevent its development. The evaluation of the depth of anesthesia with processed EEG allows to avoid awareness and burst suppression events. The cessation of brain activity is associated with the development of delirium. Another noninvasive monitoring technique is NIRS for cerebral tissue hypoxia detection by measuring regional oxygen saturation. The reduction of this parameter does not seem to be associated with the development of POD but with postoperative cognitive dysfunction. There are few studies in the literature and with conflicting results on the use of the pupillometer and transcranial Doppler in predicting the development of postoperative delirium."

          "abstract": "Humans are social animals attuned to reactions of others; however, some are exquisitely sensitive to--and often misperceive--perceptions of those they encounter. The core feature of social phobia is marked and persistent fear of embarrassment or humiliation in social situations where the individual worries that others may judge his or her performance as too much or too little. Anticipatory anxiety and avoidance occur when the individual is under scrutiny while speaking or performing publicly, eating with others, writing in public, or using public bathrooms. Diagnosis of social phobia is based largely on history obtained from the patient. Onset is usually around puberty; its course is chronic with comorbid depression common and alcohol and other substances routinely abused in misguided attempts to minimize anxiety and depressive symptoms. At examination, patients often have a moist hand, averted gaze, blushing, and other manifest signs of anxiety. Slight shyness is familiar to most, but a substantial number suffer dysfunctional and distressing social anxiety to the point that they become phobic. A few patients satisfy criteria for avoidant personality disorder, which can be socially incapacitating."

          "abstract": "Specific phobias, including animal phobias, are the most common anxiety disorders, and have a strong innate and genetic component. Research on the neurobiology and environmental constraints of innate fear of predators in rodents may be useful in elucidating mechanisms of animal phobias in humans. The present article reviews research on innate fear in rats to trimethylthiazoline (TMT), an odor originally isolated from fox feces. TMT induces unconditioned freezing and other defensive responses that are regulated by the dose of TMT and the shape of the testing environment. Contextual conditioning induced by TMT occurs, but is constrained by the environment. Lesion studies indicate the amygdala circuitry subserving fear conditioning is not necessary for unconditioned fear to TMT. Additionally, a medial hypothalamic defensive circuit also appears not necessary for unconditioned freezing to TMT, whereas circuits that include the medial nucleus of the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis are essential. The importance of these findings of innate predator odor fear in rodents to animal phobias in humans is discussed."

          "abstract": "Social phobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by heightened fear and avoidance of one or more social or performance situations, including public speaking, meeting new people, eating or writing in front of others, and attending social gatherings. People with social phobia are typically anxious about the possibility that others will evaluate them negatively and/or notice symptoms of their anxiety. Social phobia affects up to 13% of individuals at some time in their lives and is usually associated with at least moderate functional impairment. Research on the nature and treatment of social phobia has increased dramatically over the past decade. As with many of the anxiety disorders, sensitive assessment instruments and effective treatments now exist for people suffering from heightened social anxiety. Typical assessment strategies include clinical interviews, behavioural assessments, monitoring diaries, and self-report questionnaires. Treatments with demonstrated efficacy for social phobia include pharmacotherapy (for example, phenelzine, moclobemide, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] medications) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (for example, cognitive restructuring, in vivo exposure, social skills training). Although preliminary comparative studies suggest that both approaches are about equally effective in the short term, each approach has advantages and disadvantages over the other. Trials examining combined psychological and pharmacological treatments are now under way, although no published data on the relative efficacy of combined treatments are currently available."

We propose Pain, Disgust, Vasovagal response, Visual-vestibular and postural interactions, Movement and Speed, Distance and Size, Low and mid-level visual features, Smell, and Territory and social status. We subdivide phobias according to the fear-eliciting elements most frequently triggered by them and their impact on behavior. We discuss the implications of a clinical conceptualization of phobias in humans by reconsidering the current nosology. This conceptualization will facilitate finding etiological factors in defensive behavior expression, fine-tuning exposure techniques, and challenging preconceived notions of preparedness. This approach to phobias leads to surprising discoveries and shows how specific responses bear little relation to the interpretation we might later give to them. Dividing fears into their potentially fear-eliciting elements can also help in applying the research principles formulated by the Research Domain Criteria initiative."

Additional clinical information is often available along with imaging data but is mostly ignored in the current practice of data-driven deep learning modeling. In this work, we propose a novel deep curriculum learning method that utilizes radiomics information as a source of additional knowledge to guide training using customized curriculums. Specifically, we define a new measure, termed radiomics score, to capture the difficulty of classifying a set of samples. We use the radiomics score to enable a newly designed curriculum-based training scheme. In this scheme, the loss function component is weighted and initialized by the corresponding radiomics score of each sample, and furthermore, the weights are continuously updated in the course of training based on our customized curriculums to enable curriculum learning. We implement and evaluate our methods on a typical computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer. Our experiment results show benefits of the proposed method when compared to a direct use of radiomics model, a baseline CNN without using any knowledge, the standard curriculum learning using data resampling, an existing difficulty score from self-teaching, and previous methods that use radiomics features as additional input to CNN models."

However, CNNs are difficult to train from scratch for medical images due to small sample sizes and variations in tumor presentations. Instead, transfer learning can be used to extract tumor information from medical images via CNNs originally pretrained for nonmedical tasks, alleviating the need for large datasets. Our database includes 219 breast lesions (607 full-field digital mammographic images). We compared support vector machine classifiers based on the CNN-extracted image features and our prior computer-extracted tumor features in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions. Five-fold cross validation (by lesion) was conducted with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve as the performance metric. Results show that classifiers based on CNN-extracted features (with transfer learning) perform comparably to those using analytically extracted features [area under the ROC curve [Formula: see text]]. Further, the performance of ensemble classifiers based on both types was significantly better than that of either classifier type alone ([Formula: see text] versus 0.81, [Formula: see text]). We conclude that transfer learning can improve current CADx methods while also providing standalone classifiers without large datasets, facilitating machine-learning methods in radiomics and precision medicine."

          "abstract": "Radiomics and deep learning have emerged as two distinct approaches to medical image analysis. However, their relative expressive power remains largely unknown. Theoretically, hand-crafted radiomic features represent a mere subset of features that neural networks can approximate, thus making deep learning a more powerful approach. On the other hand, automated learning of hand-crafted features may require a prohibitively large number of training samples. Here we directly test the ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn and predict the intensity, shape, and texture properties of tumors as defined by standardized radiomic features. Conventional 2D and 3D CNN architectures with an increasing number of convolutional layers were trained to predict the values of 16 standardized radiomic features from real and synthetic PET images of tumors, and tested. In addition, several ImageNet-pretrained advanced networks were tested. A total of 4000 images were used for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing. Features quantifying size and intensity were predicted with high accuracy, while shape irregularity and heterogeneity features had very high prediction errors and generalized poorly. For example, mean normalized prediction error of tumor diameter with a 5-layer CNN was 4.23 ± 0.25, while the error for tumor sphericity was 15.64 ± 0.93. We additionally found that learning shape features required an order of magnitude more samples compared to intensity and size features. Our findings imply that CNNs trained to perform various image-based clinical tasks may generally under-utilize the shape and texture information that is more easily captured by radiomics. We speculate that to improve the CNN performance, shape and texture features can be computed explicitly and added as auxiliary variables to the networks, or supplied as synthetic inputs."

Since speech signals exhibit both of these properties, we hypothesize that CNNs are a more effective model for speech compared to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we explore applying CNNs to large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR) tasks. First, we determine the appropriate architecture to make CNNs effective compared to DNNs for LVCSR tasks. Specifically, we focus on how many convolutional layers are needed, what is an appropriate number of hidden units, what is the best pooling strategy. Second, investigate how to incorporate speaker-adapted features, which cannot directly be modeled by CNNs as they do not obey locality in frequency, into the CNN framework. Third, given the importance of sequence training for speech tasks, we introduce a strategy to use ReLU+dropout during Hessian-free sequence training of CNNs. Experiments on 3 LVCSR tasks indicate that a CNN with the proposed speaker-adapted and ReLU+dropout ideas allow for a 12%-14% relative improvement in WER over a strong DNN system, achieving state-of-the art results in these 3 tasks."

In this work, we propose an interactive framework to allow clinicians to ask what-if questions and intervene in the decisions of a CNN, with the aim of increasing trust in the system. The framework translates a layer of a trained CNN into a measurable and compact set of symbolic rules. Expert interactions with visualizations of the rules promote the use of clinically-relevant CNN kernels and attach meaning to the rules. The definition and relevance of the kernels are supported by radiomics analyses and permutation evaluations, respectively. CNN kernels that do not have a clinically-meaningful interpretation are removed without affecting model performance. By allowing clinicians to evaluate the impact of adding or removing kernels from the rule set, our approach produces an interpretable refinement of the data-driven CNN in alignment with medical best practice."

These tumors have been studied only on the basis of subjective computed tomography findings. Among various methodologies, radiomics, and deep learning algorithms, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have recently been confirmed to achieve significant success by outperforming the state-of-the-art performance in medical image pattern classification and have rapidly become leading methodologies in this field. However, the existing methods generally use radiomics or deep convolutional features independently for pattern classification, which tend to take into account only global or local features, respectively. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a hybrid structure that includes different features selected with radiomics model and CNNs and integrates these features to deal with GISTs classification. The Radiomics model and CNNs are constructed for global radiomics and local convolutional feature selection, respectively. Subsequently, we utilize distinct radiomics and deep convolutional features to perform pattern classification for GISTs. Specifically, we propose a new pooling strategy to assemble the deep convolutional features of 54 three-dimensional patches from the same case and integrate these features with the radiomics features for independent case, followed by random forest classifier. Our method can be extensively evaluated using multiple clinical datasets.

          "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play an important role in pathological initiation, progression and maintenance. Because identification in the laboratory of disease-related miRNAs is not straightforward, numerous network-based methods have been developed to predict novel miRNAs in silico. Homogeneous networks (in which every node is a miRNA) based on the targets shared between miRNAs have been widely used to predict their role in disease phenotypes. Although such homogeneous networks can predict potential disease-associated miRNAs, they do not consider the roles of the target genes of the miRNAs. Here, we introduce a novel method based on a heterogeneous network that not only considers miRNAs but also the corresponding target genes in the network model. Instead of constructing homogeneous miRNA networks, we built heterogeneous miRNA networks consisting of both miRNAs and their target genes, using databases of known miRNA-target gene interactions. In addition, as recent studies demonstrated reciprocal regulatory relations between miRNAs and their target genes, we considered these heterogeneous miRNA networks to be undirected, assuming mutual miRNA-target interactions. Next, we introduced a novel method (RWRMTN) operating on these mutual heterogeneous miRNA networks to rank candidate disease-related miRNAs using a random walk with restart (RWR) based algorithm. Using both known disease-associated miRNAs and their target genes as seed nodes, the method can identify additional miRNAs involved in the disease phenotype. Experiments indicated that RWRMTN outperformed two existing state-of-the-art methods: RWRMDA, a network-based method that also uses a RWR on homogeneous (rather than heterogeneous) miRNA networks, and RLSMDA, a machine learning-based method. Interestingly, we could relate this performance gain to the emergence of \"disease modules\" in the heterogeneous miRNA networks used as input for the algorithm. Moreover, we could demonstrate that RWRMTN is stable, performing well when using both experimentally validated and predicted miRNA-target gene interaction data for network construction. Finally, using RWRMTN, we identified 76 novel miRNAs associated with 23 disease phenotypes which were present in a recent database of known disease-miRNA associations. Summarizing, using random walks on mutual miRNA-target networks improves the prediction of novel disease-associated miRNAs because of the existence of \"disease modules\" in these networks."

Identifying the causal relationships between diseases is a significant research field, since it expedites the identification of underlying disease pathogenesis mechanisms and promote better disease prevention and treatment. SemRep is an effective tool for semantic relationship extraction in the biomedical field, but it is not accurate enough for disease causality extraction, bringing challenges for downstream tasks. In this study, we proposed an optimization strategy for SemRep to enhance its accuracy in disease causality extraction. This study aims to optimize disease causality extraction of SemRep tool by constructing a semantic predicate vocabulary that precisely expresses disease causality to support the automatic extraction of disease causality knowledge from biomedical literature. The proposed method invloves the following four steps: Firstly, we obtained a collection of semantic feature words expressing disease causality based on current causality predicate studies and the disease causality pairs extracted from SemMedDB. Then, we constructed a disease causality semantic predicate vocabulary by filtering and evaluating the clue words using quantitative comparisons. Following that, we extracted disease causality pairs from the biomedical literature using 36 semantic predicates with an accuracy greater than 80% for more meaningful knowledge discovery. Finally, we conducted knowledge discovery based on the extracted disease causality triples, which primarily includes unidirectional disease causality, bidirectional disease causality, as well as two specific types of disease causality: primary disease causality and rare disease causality. We obtained a disease causality semantic predicate vocabulary containing 50 textual predicates with an accuracy of above 40%. 36 semantic predicates from the 60% accuracy group were used for disease causality extraction, yielding 259,434 disease causality pairs for subsequent knowledge discovery. Among them, 92,557 types with 176,010 unidirectional disease causality triples, and 6084 types with 83,424 bidirectional disease causality triples were found eventually. Two other types of disease causality, primary disease causality and rare disease causality, were also discovered. The novelty of this research is that the proposed method enhanced the disease causality extraction of SemRep tool, resulting a more accurate and comprehensive disease causality extraction. It also facilitates an automatic disease causality extraction from large-scale biomedical literature. Additionally, a customized extraction of disease causality for its accuracy and comprehensiveness can be made possible by leveraging the quantified causality predicate vocabulary, allowing for flexible extraction of disease causality according to the actual circumstance."

          "title": "Diseases of meaning, manifestations of health, and metaphor.",
          "abstract": "Disease and health are commonly thought of as distinct opposites. We propose a different view in which both may be seen to be facets of healthy functioning, each necessary for the other, each giving rise to the other. Thus, disease may be thought of as a manifestation of health. It is the healthy response of an organism striving to maintain physical, psychologic, and spiritual equilibrium. Disease is not necessarily to be avoided, blocked, or suppressed. Rather, it should be understood to be a process of transformation. The process should therefore be facilitated because it is an integral part of the dynamic equilibrium that we ordinarily think of as health. In many cases, perhaps all, people get ill because there is something going \"wrong\" in their lives. This could occur in a whole range of ways-relationships, environment, food, or job. Our view, however, is that disease is a meaningful state that can inform health workers how to help patients to heal themselves. In this way, instead of being meaningless, people's problems become diseases of meaning, enabling people to see that things are not necessarily \"going wrong\" but are, in fact, helping them become stronger, to live more fully and with more understanding. Seen from this perspective, depression; cancer; heart disease; neurodegenerative and autoimmune disease; dementia; and conditions such as community violence, genocide, and the problem of environmental devastation are \"diseases of meaning.\" World Health Organization forecasts make it clear that diseases of meaning will continue well into the next millennium to be the major cause of suffering and death worldwide. To deal with them, the world needs to reformulate the biomolecular paradigm that has been exploited in the last two centuries. It does not address the reasons why these diseases arise, attending mainly to their molecular consequences. A paradigm that includes the importance of meaning must now be given top priority. The concept that diseases are a manifestation of health-a call to a different relationship with ourselves and our environment, both animate and inanimate- is in itself a different approach. Programs for care and education based upon it would have immediate application in medicine, industry, education and ecology. We believe that this model would have far-reaching consequences for the understanding, treatment, and prevention of diseases and behaviors that lead to violence and environmental destruction."

          "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to a rapid increase in available data on common genetic variants and phenotypes and numerous discoveries of new loci associated with susceptibility to common complex diseases. Integrating the evidence from GWAS and candidate gene studies depends on concerted efforts in data production, online publication, database development, and continuously updated data synthesis. Here the authors summarize current experience and challenges on these fronts, which were discussed at a 2008 multidisciplinary workshop sponsored by the Human Genome Epidemiology Network. Comprehensive field synopses that integrate many reported gene-disease associations have been systematically developed for several fields, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, bladder cancer, coronary heart disease, preterm birth, and DNA repair genes in various cancers. The authors summarize insights from these field synopses and discuss remaining unresolved issues -- especially in the light of evidence from GWAS, for which they summarize empirical P-value and effect-size data on 223 discovered associations for binary outcomes (142 with P < 10(-7)). They also present a vision of collaboration that builds reliable cumulative evidence for genetic associations with common complex diseases and a transparent, distributed, authoritative knowledge base on genetic variation and human health. As a next step in the evolution of Human Genome Epidemiology reviews, the authors invite investigators to submit field synopses for possible publication in the American Journal of Epidemiology."

          "title": "Imprinted genes and human disease: an evolutionary perspective.",
          "abstract": "Imprinted genes have been associated with a wide range of diseases. Many of these diseases have symptoms that can be understood in the context of the evolutionary forces that favored imprinted expression at these loci. Modulation of perinatal growth and resource acquisition has played a central role in the evolution of imprinting and many of the diseases associated with imprinted genes involve some sort of growth or feeding disorder. In the first part of this chapter, we discuss the relationship between the evolution of imprinting and the clinical manifestations of imprinting-associated diseases. In the second half, we consider the variety of processes that can disrupt imprinted gene expression and function. We ask specifically if there is reason to believe that imprinted genes are particularly susceptible to deregulation-and whether a disruption of an imprinted gene is more likely to have deleterious consequences than a disruption of an unimprinted gene. There is more to a gene than its DNA sequence. C. H. Waddington used the term \"epigenetic\" to describe biological differences between tissues that result from the process of development. Waddington needed a new term to describe this variation which was neither the result of genotypic differences between the cells nor well described as phenotypic variation. We now understand that heritable modifications of the DNA--such as cytosine methylation--and aspects of chromatin structure--including histone modifications--are the mechanisms underlying what Waddington called the \"epigenotype.\" Epigenetic modifications are established in particular cell lines during development and are responsible for the patterns of gene expression seen in different tissue types. In contemporary usage, the term epigenetic refers to heritable changes in gene expression that are not coded in the DNA sequence itself. In recent years, much attention has been paid to a particular type of epigenetic variation: genomic imprinting. In the case of imprinting, the maternally and paternally inherited genes within a single cell have epigenetic differences that result in divergent patterns of gene expression. In the simplest scenario, only one of the two alleles at an imprinted locus is expressed. In other cases, an imprinted locus can include a variety of maternally expressed, paternally expressed and biallelically expressed transcripts. Some of these transcripts produce different proteins through alternate splicing, while others produce noncoding RNA transcripts. Genomic imprinting can also interact with the \"epigenotype\" in Waddington's sense: many genes are imprinted in a tissue-specific manner, with monoallelic expression in some cell types and biallelic expression in others. Other chapters in this volume cover our current understanding of the mechanisms of imprinting, the phenotypic effects of imprinted genes in mammals and what we know about imprinting in plants. In this chapter we discuss the link between imprinted genes and human disease. First, we consider the phenotypes associated with imprinted genes and ask whether the disorders associated with these genes share a common motif. Second, we consider the nature and frequency of mutations of imprinted genes. We ask whether we should expect that imprinted genes are particularly fragile. That is, are they more likely to undergo mutation and/or are mutations of imprinted genes particularly likely to result in human disease? In general we consider how the field of evolutionary medicine--the use of evolution to understand why our body's design allows for the existence of disease at all--might contribute to our comprehension of disorders linked to genomic imprinting."

However, a comprehensive, stand-alone review of adoption studies in this area is unavailable, nor are there data on what people actually believe about adoption study findings. To reassess the available adoption studies of suicide and to provide novel data on beliefs relating to these. Key findings of the 3 existing adoption studies of suicide were reviewed and subjected to a meta-analysis. Beliefs pertaining to these were analyzed in 10 samples (total N = 1379) of different types (medical and psychology students, general population) from 6 countries. The combined evidence from adoption studies clearly supported genetic factors in suicide. Critical tests showed that suicide runs in the biological families of suicided (as well as schizophrenic or affectively ill) adoptees, but not in those of demographically matched healthy control adoptees alive (relative risk RR = 8.38, p = 0.0002). Individuals' beliefs about the plausibility of these findings were inconsistent and self-contradictory. Particularly, it was widely disbelieved that adoptees' risk of suicide resembles the one of their biological, not their adoptive, relatives (which is the case). Despite demonstrating a significant genetic effect, the evidence base from adoption studies of suicide is narrow. To broaden the evidence remains an important research agenda. Gaps in and deficiencies of this specific literature as well as general limitations of adoption study designs are discussed."

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that suicidal behavior is heritable, suggesting that genetic and epigenetic information may serve as biomarkers for suicide risk. Here we systematically review the literature on genetic and epigenetic alterations observed in phenotypes across the full range of self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITB). We included 577 studies focused on genome-wide and epigenome-wide associations, candidate genes (SNP and methylation), noncoding RNAs, and histones. Convergence of specific genes is limited across units of analysis, although pathway-based analyses do indicate nervous system development and function and immunity/inflammation as potential underlying mechanisms of SITB. We provide suggestions for future work on the genetic and epigenetic correlates of SITB with a specific focus on measurement issues."

Studies investigating genetic factors increasing suicide predisposition have been limited by current knowledge of the suicide neurobiology and have typically investigated one or a few genes at a time, whereas it is anticipated that several genes account for the total genetic variance mediating suicide. This review focuses on the advantages and the interest of using the microarray technology to investigate the neurobiology of suicide and discusses, by means of a data analysis example, the possible methodological problems and bioinformatic strategies that should be employed in order to separate the signal from the large amount of background noise, which is usually generated in such studies.

          "abstract": "This article provides a review of the ethical considerations that drive research policy and practice related to the genetic study of suicide. As the tenth cause of death worldwide, suicide constitutes a substantial public health concern. Biometrical studies and population-based molecular genetic studies provide compelling evidence of the utility of investigating genetic underpinnings of suicide. International, federal, and institutional policies regulating research are explored through the lenses of the ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. Trapped between the Common Rule's definition of human subjects, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act's protected information, suicide decedent data occupy an ethical gray area fraught with jurisdictional, legal, and social implications. Two avenues of research, biobanks and psychological autopsies, provide tangible application for the ethical principles examining the risks to participants and their families. Additionally, studies surveying public opinion about research methods, especially broad consent, are explored. Our approach of applying the four ethical principles to policy, sample collection, data storage, and secondary research applications can also be applied to genetic research with other populations. We conclude that broad consent for secondary research, as well as next-of-kin at the time of autopsy, serve to satisfy privacy and confidentiality under the ethical principle of autonomy. We recommend ongoing ethical evaluation of research policy and practice."

          "abstract": "There is now convergent evidence from classic quantitative genetics (family, twin, and adoption studies) and molecular genetic studies for specific genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior. This emerging research field has recently been supplemented by geographical studies concerned with the Finno-Ugrian Suicide Hypothesis (FUSH), which states that population differences in genetic risk factors may partially account for conspicuous geographical patterns seen in suicide prevalence. In particular, the European high-suicide-rate nations constitute a contiguous, J-shaped belt, spanning from Finland to Austria. This area maps onto the second principal component identified for European gene distribution, most likely reflecting a major migration event of the past (i.e., the ancestral adaptation to cold climates and the Uralic language dispersion) still detectable in modern European populations. The present research tested the hypothesis in the United States. Consistent with the hypothesis, available historical (1913-1924 and 1928-1932) U.S. state suicide rates were uniformly positively associated with available state proportions of reported American ancestries from European high-suicide-rate countries (Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the Ukraine). However, contrary to the hypothesis, available contemporary (1990-1994) suicide rates were uniformly negatively associated with these ancestry proportions. The findings of this first test outside Europe are therefore conflicting. A proposal based on the geographical study approach is offered to further the progress of investigations into the genetics of suicide."

The high percentage of suicide positive family histories as compared to the literature are due to exceptionally good sources of information. It could be shown that in suicide cases which were also suffering from endogenous depression, both endogenous psychoses and suicides appeared to a greater extent in their families. In contrast to current assumptions, however, the suicide disposition is not just found in those with endogenous psychoses, but shows a separate genetic determination. The author concludes, without wanting to generalize prematurely, that the genetic factor in suicide research and in the evaluation of suicidality equally be respected as are psychodynamic and sociodynamic factors."

Another way to approach the genetics of affective disorders is the definition of more detailed phenotypes. Suicidal behaviour is one of the more largely studied subphenotypes within affective disorders. Tryptophan hydroxylase and serotonin transporter genes, related to the serotonergic pathway, have been found to be associated to suicidal behaviour, in particular violent suicidal behaviour but need to be replicated before definitive conclusion.

However, suicide in psychosis is still poorly characterized, partly due to a lack of adequate population-based clinical or genetic data on suicide death. The Utah Suicide Genetics Research Study (USGRS) provides a large population-based cohort of suicide deaths with medical record and genome-wide data (N = 4380). Examination of this cohort identified medical and genetic risks associated with type of suicide death and investigated the relative contributions of psychotic and affective symptoms to method of suicide. Key differences in method of suicide (common vs. atypical methods) were tested in relation to lifetime psychosis and genome-wide genetic risk for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and neuroticism. Consistent with previous studies, psychosis-spectrum disorders were observed to be common in suicide (15% of the cohort). Individuals with psychosis more frequently died from atypical methods, with rates of atypical suicide increasing across the schizophrenia spectrum. Genetic risk for schizophrenia was also associated with atypical suicide, regardless of clinical diagnosis, though this association weakened when filtering individuals with schizophrenia from the analysis. Follow-up examination indicated that high rates of atypical suicide observed in schizophrenia are not likely accounted for by restricted access to firearms. Overall, better accounting for the increased risk of atypical suicide methods in psychosis could lead to improved prevention strategies in a large portion of the suicide risk population."

The labile nature of some post-translational modifications puts obstacles in the path of attempting to detect modified species of most proteins. Indeed, ubiquitination can be rapidly reversed by the action of a large family of DUBs (deubiquitinating enzymes), most of which are cysteine proteases. This, taken together with the rapid proteasomal degradation of some species of ubiquitinated proteins, results in difficulties in detecting modified targets. In this review, practical approaches developed for the detection, purification and characterization of ubiquitinated proteins are reviewed.

The evaluation of ROS in semen seems promising as a potential diagnostic tool for male infertility and male preconception care with a number of clinically available tests on the market (MiOXSYS, luminol chemiluminescence and OxiSperm). While some of these tests show promise for clinical use, discrepancies in documented decision limits and lack of cohort studies/clinical trials assessing their benefits on fertilization rates, embryo development, pregnancy and live birth rates limit their current clinical utility. In this review, we provide an update on the current techniques used for analyzing semen ROS concentrations clinically, the potential to use of ROS research tools for improving clinical ROS detection in sperm and describe why we believe we are likely still a long way away before semen ROS concentrations might become a mainstream preconception diagnostic test in men."

          "abstract": "The chemiluminescence method is the most commonly employed technique as a direct measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by spermatozoa. This assay is capable of quantifying both intracellular and extracellular ROS. Moreover, the use of various probes allows for differentiation between superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by spermatozoa. When the total antioxidant reserves are overwhelmed by excessive production of ROS, it results in oxidative stress. Therefore correct measurement of both ROS and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) is essential in the assessment of oxidative stress in sperm and semen. This chapter describes the methodological approach for measuring seminal oxidative stress through the use of chemiluminescence assay for accurate measurement of ROS and the colorimetric assay for measurement of TAC."

          "abstract": "The expanding research interest in the last two decades on reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative stress, and male infertility has led to the development of various techniques for evaluating oxidative DNA damage in human spermatozoa. Measurement of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) offers a specific and quantitative biomarker on the extent of oxidative DNA damage caused by ROS in human sperm. The close correlations of 8-OHdG level with male fertility, sperm function and routine seminal parameters indicate the potential diagnostic value of this technique in clinical applications. On the other hand, single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE or comet assay) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay have also been demonstrated to be sensitive, and reliable methods for measuring DNA strand breaks in human spermatozoa. As certain technical limitations were inherent in each of these tests, it is believed that a combination of these assays will offer more comprehensive information for a better understanding of oxidative DNA damage and its biological significance in sperm function and male infertility."

          "abstract": "Male infertility affects men worldwide. Oxidative stress (OS), characterized by an overabundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or a deficiency of antioxidants, is one of the major causes of male infertility. OS causes damage at the molecular level, which impairs lipids, proteins, and DNA. The cyclic cascade of redox reactions weakens sperm function which leads to poor semen parameters and eventual sterility. There is a need for advanced diagnostic tests that can quickly and accurately detect OS. Most commonly used assays can only measure single constituents of OS. However, the MiOXSYS System introduces a new strategy to detect OS by measuring the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)--a direct evaluation of the redox balance between ROS and antioxidants. The MiOXSYS System has shown promise as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of male infertility. This review explores the concept of ORP, details the principle of the MiOXSYS System, and summarizes the findings in clinical studies that support ORP measurement in semen."

They are necessary to carry out various physiological functions such as sperm capacitation, hyperactivation, acrosome reaction, sperm-zona binding and cellular signalling pathways. Oxidative stress (OS) results when the ROS levels overwhelm the available antioxidant reserve. A number of direct and indirect tests have been developed to assess oxidative stress. In this manuscript, we discuss these common direct and indirect tests as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Tests measuring sperm dysfunction secondary to oxidative stress such as lipid peroxidation, DNA fragmentation and protein alterations are also described."

          "abstract": "Seminal oxidative stress (OS) is a major contributing factor to male infertility. Semen analysis cannot identify reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be measured using a chemiluminescence assay. Measurement of redox potential provides a more comprehensive assessment of OS, although the test has yet to be fully validated. This study aimed to validate the MiOX<sup>sys</sup> analyser for measuring static oxidation-reduction potential (sORP). Results demonstrated that duplicate measurements must be taken, sensors must be batch tested, and sockets should be regularly changed to avoid inconsistency in measurement. Measurement of sORP using MiOX<sup>sys</sup> exhibited good reproducibility across different operators (p = 0.469), analysers (p = 0.963) and days (p = 0.942). It is not affected by mechanical agitation (p = 0.522) or snap freezing and thawing (p = 0.823). The stability of sORP over time requires further verification, particularly in samples with high initial sORP. Measurement is temperature sensitive between 2 and 37°C, significantly increasing with increasing temperature (p = 0.0004). MiOX<sup>sys</sup> is a more stable assay for assessing OS than chemiluminescence methods and permits greater flexibility for sample handling. MiOX<sup>sys</sup> could be implemented to complement semen analysis as part of routine diagnostic testing for male infertility and may be useful in identifying contributing factors to idiopathic infertility."

This study measures ORP and evaluates the effect of exogenous induction of oxidative stress by cumene hydroperoxide (CH) on ORP in fresh and frozen semen using the MiOXSYS Analyzer. Semen samples from healthy donors (n = 20) were collected and evaluated for sperm parameters. All samples were then flash-frozen at -80°C. Oxidative stress was induced by CH (5 and 50 μmoles/ml). Static ORP (sORP-(mV/10<sup>6</sup> sperm/ml) and capacity ORP (cORP-μC/10<sup>6</sup> sperm/ml) were measured in all samples before and after freezing. All values are reported as mean ± SEM. Both 5 and 50 μmoles/ml of CH resulted in a significant decline in per cent motility compared to control in pre-freeze semen samples. The increase in both pre-freeze and post-thaw semen samples for sORP was higher in the controls than with 50 μmoles/ml of CH. The change from pre-freeze to post-thaw cORP was comparable. The system is a simple, sensitive and portable tool to measure the seminal ORP and its dynamic impact on sperm parameters in both fresh and frozen semen specimens."

To determine the normal values for superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NOx) in the seminal liquid of healthy humans. Semen samples from 45 healthy men (22 to 47 years of age) were studied. The samples were obtained by masturbation and were collected in conical sterile tubes. Once centrifuged at 4 degrees C they were divided in aliquots to measure the concentration of SOD, GPx, MDA, and NOx. The analysis of the samples was realized in conformity with biochemical widely accepted methods. The concentrations of SOD and MDA both in the seminal liquid and in the spermatozoids were similar, SOD 0.43 +/- 0.09 U/mg prot. in the seminal liquid and 0.45 +/- 0.07 U/ mg prot. in spermatozoids, and MDA 0.33 +/- 0.07 nmoles/mg prot. and 0.37 +/- 0.10 nmoles/mg prot. in the seminal liquid and spermatozoids respectively. With regard to GPx it increased almost 13 times more in the spermatozoids (2547.77 +/- 48.59 U/mg prot.) than in the seminal liquid (197.54 +/-25.21 U/mg prot.). The NOx also increased lightly in the spermatozoids (4.45 +/- 0.43 Apmol) when compared with the seminal liquid (3.91 +/- 0.16 pumol). The measurement of the antioxidative and oxidative agents could serve to evaluate human infertility in those cases where the result of the spematobioscopy appears normal."

The probes 2',7'-dichlorohydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH), dihydroethidium (DHE), and MitoSOX red (MSR) are commonly used for detecting ROS by flow cytometry; however, these probes lack sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is particularly damaging to mammalian sperm cells. This study reports the synthesis and use of three aryl boronate probes, peroxyfluor-1 (PF1), carboxyperoxyfluor-1, and a novel probe, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxyperoxyfluor-1 (EEPF1), in human spermatozoa. PF1 and EEPF1 were effective at detecting H2O2 and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) produced by spermatozoa when stimulated with menadione or 4-hydroxynonenal. EEPF1 was more effective at detection of ROS in spermatozoa than DCFH, DHE, or MSR; furthermore it distinguished poorly motile sperm as shown by greater ROS production. EEPF1 should therefore have a significant role in the diagnosis of oxidative stress in male infertility, cryopreservation, age, lifestyle, and exposure to environmental toxicants."

          "abstract": "Intestinal parasitic infections can harm health by causing malnutrition, anemia, impaired growth and cognitive development, and alterations in microbiota composition and immune responses. Therefore, it is crucial to examine stool samples to diagnose parasitic infections. However, the traditional microscopic detection method is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and dependent on the expertise and training of microscopists. Hence, there is a need for a low-complexity, high-throughput, and cost-effective alternative to labor-intensive microscopic examinations. This study aimed to compare the performance of a fully automatic digital feces analyzer, Orienter Model FA280 (People's Republic of China) with that of the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT). We assessed and compared the agreement between the FA280 and the FECT for parasite detection and species identification in stool samples. The first part of the study analyzed 200 fresh stool samples for parasite detection using the FECT and FA280. With the FA280, the automatic feces analyzer performed the testing, and the digital microscope images were uploaded and automatically evaluated using an artificial intelligence (AI) program. Additionally, a skilled medical technologist conducted a user audit of the FA280 findings. The second set of samples comprised 800 preserved stool samples (preserved in 10% formalin). These samples were examined for parasites using the FECT and FA280 with a user audit. For the first set of stool samples, there was no statistically significant difference in the pairwise agreements between the FECT and the FA280 with a user audit (exact binomial test, P = 1). However, there were statistically significant differences between the pairwise agreements for the FECT and the FA280 with the AI report (McNemar's test, P < 0.001). The agreement for the species identification of parasites between the FA280 with AI report and FECT showed fair agreement (overall agreement = 75.5%, kappa [κ] = 0.367, 95% CI 0.248-0.486). On the other hand, the user audit for the FA280 and FECT showed perfect agreement (overall agreement = 100%, κ = 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00). For the second set of samples, the FECT detected significantly more positive samples for parasites than the FA280 with a user audit (McNemar's test, P < 0.001). The disparity in results may be attributed to the FECT using significantly larger stool samples than those used by the FA280. The larger sample size used by the FECT potentially contributed to the higher parasite detection rate. Regarding species identification, there was strong agreement between the FECT and the FA280 with a user audit for helminths (κ = 0.857, 95% CI 0.82-0.894). Similarly, there was perfect agreement for the species identification of protozoa between the FECT and the FA280 with user audit (κ = 1.00, 95% CI 1.00-1.00). Although the FA280 has advantages in terms of simplicity, shorter performance time, and reduced contamination in the laboratory, there are some limitations to consider. These include a higher cost per sample testing and a lower sensitivity compared to the FECT. However, the FA280 enables rapid, convenient, and safe stool examination of parasitic infections."

Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax cause the major human malarias, with P falciparum being the more virulent. During their blood stages of infection, both P falciparum and P vivax induce anemia. Severe malarial anemia caused by P falciparum is responsible for approximately a third of the deaths associated with disease. Malarial anemia appears to be multi-factorial. It involves increased removal of circulating erythrocytes as well as decreased production of erythrocytes in the bone marrow. The molecular mechanisms underlying malarial anemia are largely unknown. Over the last five years, malaria parasite ligands have been investigated for their remodeling of erythrocytes and possible roles in destruction of mature erythrocytes. Polymorphisms in cytokines have been associated with susceptibility to severe malarial anemia: these cytokines and malaria \"toxins\" likely function by perturbing erythropoiesis. Finally a number of co-infections increase susceptibility to malarial anemia, likely because they exacerbate inflammation caused by malaria. Because of the complexities involved, the study of severe malarial anemia may need a \"systems approach\" to yield comprehensive understanding of defects in both erythropoiesis and immunity associated with disease. New and emerging tools such as (i) mathematical modeling of the dynamics of host control of malarial infection, (ii) ex vivo perfusion of human spleen to measure both infected and uninfected erythrocyte retention, and (iii) in vitro development of erythroid progenitors to dissect responsiveness to cytokine imbalance or malaria toxins, may be especially useful to develop integrated mechanistic insights and therapies to control this major and fatal disease pathology."

Previous studies have shown that proximal arterioles are largely governed by adrenergic activation, whereas it is speculated that distal branches are controlled by peptidergic and purinergic activation. However, no study has systematically evaluated the activation of adrenergic, peptidergic and purinergic receptors in continuously branching arteriolar trees of an individual skeletal muscle model. Therefore, in the present study, sympathetic agonists were used to evaluate the constriction responses along first to fifth order arterioles in continuously branching arteriolar trees of a in vivo rat gluteus maximus muscle preparation with respect to specific activation of receptors for sympathetic neurotransmitters (α1R, α2R, NPY1R and P2X1R). Constriction responses were incorporated into a mathematical blood flow model to estimate the total flow, resistance and red blood cell flow heterogeneity within a computationally reconstructed gluteus maximus arteriolar network. For the first time, the effects of activating receptors for sympathetic neurotransmitters on vasoconstrictor responses and the ensuing haemodynamics in continuously branching arteriolar trees of skeletal muscle were characterized, where proximal arterioles responded most to α1R and α2R adrenergic activation, whereas distal arterioles responded most to Y1R and P2X1R activation. Total flow and resistance changed with activation of all receptors, whereas red blood cell flow heterogeneity was largely affected by peptidergic and purinergic activation in distal arterioles. The reported data highlight the functional consequences of topologically-dependent sympathetic control and may serve as novel input parameters in computational modelling of network flow."

Wild-type mice had characteristic biphasic IJPs and pharmacological dissection confirmed that the fIJP was purinergic and the sIJP was nitrergic. The fIJP was completely absent in P2ry1(−/−) mice and the P2Y1 receptor antagonist MRS2500 had no effect on electrical activity or responses to electrical field stimulation of intrinsic nerves in these mice. Contractile experiments confirmed that purinergic responses were abolished in P2ry1(−/−) mice. Picospritzing of neurotransmitter candidates (ATP and its primary metabolite, ADP) and β-NAD (and its primary metabolite, ADP-ribose, ADPR) caused transient hyperpolarization responses in wild-type colons, but responses to β-NAD and ADPR were completely abolished in P2ry1(−/−) mice. Hyperpolarization and relaxation responses to ATP and ADP were retained in colons of P2ry1(−/−) mice. Video imaging revealed that transit of fecal pellets was significantly delayed in colons from P2ry1(−/−) mice. These data demonstrate the importance of purinergic neurotransmission in regulating colonic motility and confirm pharmacological experiments suggesting that purinergic neurotransmission is mediated via P2Y1 receptors."

          "abstract": "To identify the nature of neurotransmitters acting on the smooth muscle cells of the proximal urethra and the electrical activity underlying the mechanical responses to nerve stimulation. The electrical activity of longitudinal strips of proximal urethra obtained from male rabbits was recorded with microelectrode and double sucrose-gap techniques. Intramural nerves were stimulated with 200 microseconds pulses. Drugs which selectively affected neurotransmission were added to the perfusing fluid. The mean resting potential of smooth muscle cells was -39 mV and they had infrequent spontaneous action potentials. The frequency was increased by noradrenaline without depolarization; ATP produced depolarization with increased action-potential frequency. Small (< or = 16 mV) spontaneous depolarizations and hyperpolarizations could be recorded from < 50% of cells; large (< or = 40 mV) hyperpolarizations also occurred. Electrical field stimulation evoked excitatory and inhibitory junction potentials (EJPs and IJPs). Most EJPs reached a maximum within 500 ms, decayed with a time-constant of 200-300 ms and were blocked by alpha, beta-methylene ATP. IJPs had a latency of > 1 s and showed much variation in amplitude and duration. IJPs could still be recorded in the presence of N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In the double sucrose-gap, depolarization and associated contraction were reduced by alpha, beta-methylene ATP. Further reduction occurred with phentolamine and the remaining response was blocked by atropine. A large hyperpolarization could occur in response to a single stimulus but this decreased progressively with repeated stimulation. The hyperpolarization was partially blocked by L-NAME. The proximal urethra receives excitatory innervation involving three neurotransmitters, i.e. ATP, acetylcholine and noradrenaline, and inhibition is associated with hyperpolarization which results at least in part from action of non-nitrergic nerves."

          "abstract": "The enteric nervous system (ENS) is responsible for the genesis of motor patterns ensuring an appropriate intestinal transit. Enteric neurons are classified into afferent, interneuron, and motoneuron types, with the latter two being further categorized as excitatory or inhibitory, which cause smooth muscle contraction or inhibition, respectively. Muscle relaxation mechanisms are key for the understanding of physiological processes such as sphincter relaxation, gastric accommodation, or descending peristaltic reflex. Nitric oxide (NO) and ATP or a related purine represent the primary inhibitory neurotransmitters. Nitrergic neurons synthesize NO through nNOS enzyme activity. NO diffuses across the cell membrane to bind its receptor, namely, guanylyl cyclase, and then activates a number of intracellular mechanisms that ultimately result in muscle relaxation. ATP acts as an inhibitory neurotransmitter together with NO, and the purinergic P2Y1 membrane receptor has been identified as a key item in order to understand how ATP may relax intestinal smooth muscle. Although, probably, no clinician doubts the significance of NO in the pathophysiology of digestive motility, the relevance of purinergic neurotransmission is apparently much lower, as ATP has not been associated with any specific motor dysfunction yet. The goal of this review is to discuss the function of both relaxation mechanisms in order to establish the physiological grounds of potential motor dysfunctions arising from impaired intestinal relaxation."

Acetylcholine, the principal neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, is released at both ganglionic synapses and postganglionic neuroeffector junctions and acts by activation of nicotinic and muscarinic cholinoceptors. This review focuses on the effects of postjunctional muscarinic stimulation of airway smooth muscle. 2. On pharmacological criteria, four distinct subtypes of muscarinic cholinoceptor, denoted M1, M2, M3 and M4 receptors, have been identified by use of selective antagonists. Cloned muscarinic cholinoceptors are members of the family of GTP-binding protein-coupled receptors, which are characterized by seven transmembrane (TM) regions connected by intra- and extracellular loops. Between the fifth and the sixth TM regions, muscarinic receptors possess a large intracytoplasmic loop that is considered to be responsible for G-protein-coupling selectivity and exhibits high divergence between the different subtypes. 3. At the site of the smooth muscle itself, both binding and Northern blot studies have demonstrated, in a variety of species, that muscarinic receptor subtypes present are M2 and M3. M2 receptors are coupled to Gi proteins and adenylyl cyclase inhibition and thus to cAMP signaling. M3 receptors are coupled to Gq/11 protein and phosphoinositide hydrolysis and thus to calcium signaling. 4. Muscarinic-induced contraction of airway smooth muscle is mediated by M3 receptors. M2-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase contributes to the prevention of bronchodilation. Cross-talk between muscarinic and beta2 adrenoceptors is likely to be present in airway smooth muscle. The pathophysiological role of this cross-talk requires further investigation."

In this study, we evaluated whether activation of β3-ARs by the selective agonist CL316,243 modifies the functional and structural properties of skeletal muscles of healthy mice. Daily injections of CL316,243 for 15 days resulted in a significant improvement in muscle force production, assessed by grip strength and weight tests, and an increased myofiber cross-sectional area, indicative of muscle hypertrophy. In addition, atomic force microscopy revealed a significant effect of CL316,243 on the transversal stiffness of isolated muscle fibers. Interestingly, the expression level of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) downstream targets and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was also found to be enhanced in tibialis anterior and soleus muscles of CL316,243 treated mice, in accordance with previous data linking β3-ARs to mTOR and NOS signaling pathways.

However, how force generation is enhanced through adrenergic activation in different muscle types is not fully understood. We studied the effects of isoproterenol (ISO, β-receptor agonist) on force generation and energy metabolism in isolated mouse soleus (SOL, oxidative) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL, glycolytic) muscles. Muscles were stimulated with isometric tetanic contractions and analyzed for metabolites and phosphorylase activity. Under conditions of maximal force production, ISO enhanced force generation markedly more in SOL (22%) than in EDL (8%). Similarly, during a prolonged tetanic contraction (30 s for SOL and 10 s for EDL), ISO-enhanced the force × time integral more in SOL (25%) than in EDL (3%). ISO induced marked activation of phosphorylase in both muscles in the basal state, which was associated with glycogenolysis (less in SOL than in EDL), and in EDL only, a significant decrease (16%) in inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>). ATP turnover during sustained contractions (1 s EDL, 5 s SOL) was not affected by ISO in EDL, but essentially doubled in SOL. Under conditions of maximal stimulation, ISO has a minor effect on force generation in EDL that is associated with a decrease in P<sub>i</sub>, whereas ISO has a marked effect on force generation in SOL that is associated with an increase in ATP turnover. Thus, phosphorylase functions as a phosphate trap in ISO-mediated force enhancement in EDL and as a catalyzer of ATP supply in SOL."

          "abstract": "Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a systemic disorder that occurs in patients with renal failure and manifests as a thickening of the skin and flexion contractures of the joints. The etiology may involve an exposure to a gadolinium (Gd)-based magnetic resonance contrast agent. It has been proposed that in hemodialysis (HD) patients, iron mobilization (decreased total iron-binding capacity, increased iron level, and transferrin oversaturation) causes a transmetallation reaction and the release of free Gd from its chelator with the deposition of both Gd and iron in the affected tissues leading to fibrosis. The objective of this study was to investigate whether the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine leads to iron mobilization and to the development of NSF in HD patients. A retrospective chart analysis of 236 HD patients was performed and patients who had received a Gd-containing contrast agent were selected for analysis of their iron studies before and after the Gd exposure. A total of 25 patients were identified as having had a magnetic resonance imaging study and all were administered gadopentetate dimeglumine and no patients had any signs or symptoms suggestive of NSF. Six patients had the appropriate iron studies, which showed no statistically significant difference in the serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, or transferrin saturation before and after exposure to gadopentetate dimeglumine. Our data suggest that the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine in HD patients did not cause iron mobilization and transmetallation therefore may partially explain the lack of development of NSF seen in our patient population."

          "abstract": "Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is a systemic illness, which only affects patients with kidney failure. NSF risk increases with progressively lower levels of kidney function. It is characterized by red skin areas or plaques that develop over several weeks to painful thickened skin with a \"woody\" texture, resembling \"peau d'orange.\" It may ultimately cause flexion contractures of joints. Skin biopsy reveals thickened collagen bundles, mucin deposition, proliferation of fibroblasts and elastic fibers, without inflammation. Originally described as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy (NFD), because of its primarily cutaneous manifestation, it was renamed NSF because of the involvement of various organs like the lungs, myocardium, or striated muscles. The pathogenesis of the disease is not known yet, but recently we suggested a strong association between development of NSF and exposure to gadolinium-based contrast (GBC) agents, thereafter confirmed by other authors. As a consequence of our recent observations, medical authorities imposed restrictions that exclude patients with advanced levels of renal insufficiency from potentially important magnetic resonance imaging studies with gadolinium. Unfortunately, the only alternatives in many situations (examination of brain, lungs, vasculature) are imaging modalities using iodinated radiocontrast agents. Thus, clinicians are faced with weighing the potential risk of NSF from GBC exposure against the risk of acute kidney injury-associated with radiocontrast media. In this dilemma, clinicians must identify patients at high-risk to develop NSF. Known risk factors critical for the development of NSF after exposure to GBC agents (certain chelates and higher doses) are end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis, especially those with little or no residual renal function, and advanced kidney disease not on dialysis. Other potential risk factors include metabolic acidosis, iron overload/intravenous iron, divalent ion disturbances, endothelial/vascular injury, and high erythropoietin doses. Further studies are required."

An improvement of lesions is possible, especially in case of resolution of the renal insufficiency. Several treatments have been evaluated, but none has shown consistent benefit. The toxic culprit is likely to be the gadolinium ions (Gd(+++)), released from some contrast agents used in nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence of the responsibility of Gd(+++) is based on epidemiologic, biochemical and experimental data. Recommendations have been published for patients with renal insufficiency requiring a nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.

It is pertinent to the field of podiatry because patients with NSF first manifest cutaneous symptoms in the lower extremity in the form of fibrosing lesions. To date, these lesions have been documented only in people with moderate to severe kidney failure. There is speculation that gadolinium, used as a contrast agent for imaging, might be the inciting factor that triggers a cascade of events that results in the inappropriate fibrosis both in the dermis and in deeper tissues. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been shown to cause these lesions in the lungs, pleura, diaphragm, myocardium, pericardium, and dura mater, the presence of which are typically indicative of severe progression of NSF. In cases where the lesions are manifest in the periarticular tissue, joint contractures and restricted range of motion can often result.

In addition to environmental risk factors, each disorder has a strong genetic basis that is likely due to the summation of small to moderate effects from a large number of genetic loci. Obesity is a strong risk factor for sleep apnea, and there are some data to suggest sleep apnea may influence obesity. It is therefore not surprising that many susceptibility genes for obesity and OSA should be shared. Current research suggests that approximately half of the genetic variance in the apnea hypopnea index is shared with obesity phenotypes. Genetic polymorphisms that increase weight will also be risk factors for apnea. In addition, given the interrelated pathways regulating both weight and other intermediate phenotypes for sleep apnea such as ventilatory control, upper airway muscle function, and sleep characteristics, it is likely that there are genes with pleiotropic effects independently impacting obesity and OSA traits. Other genetic loci likely interact with obesity to influence development of OSA in a gene-by-environment type of effect. Conversely, environmental stressors such as intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation produced by OSA may interact with obesity susceptibility genes to modulate the importance that these loci have on defining obesity-related traits."

There are three modalities of obesity therapies: 1) lifestyle modification, which includes changes in dietary intake and physical activity, along with behavioral interventions; 2) pharmacologic agents; and 3) bariatric surgery. Individuals have a highly variable response to the various obesity interventions, and maintenance of weight loss can be especially challenging. These factors influence the effect of weight loss on sleep disorders. There is still a need for large, well-controlled studies examining short- and long-term efficacy of weight loss modalities and their impact on long-term treatment of OSAS and other sleep parameters, particularly in youth. Nonetheless, given our current knowledge, weight reduction should always be encouraged for people coping with obesity, OSAS, and/or sleep disruptions and resources identified to assist patients in choosing a weight loss approach that will benefit them the most."

          "abstract": "Obesity is a primary risk factor for the development of obstructive sleep apnea in humans, but the impact of obesity on central sleep apnea is less clear. Given the comorbidities associated with obesity in humans, we developed techniques for long-term recording of diaphragmatic EMG activity and polysomnography in obese mice to assess breathing patterns during sleep and to determine the effect of obesity on apnea generation. We hypothesized that genetically obese ob/ob mice would exhibit less variability in breathing across the 24-h circadian cycle, be more prone to central apneas, and be more likely to exhibit patterns of increased diaphragm muscle activity consistent with obstructive apneas compared with lean mice. Unexpectedly, we found that obese mice exhibited a greater circadian impact on respiratory rate and diaphragmatic burst amplitude than lean mice, particularly during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Central apneas were more common in REM sleep (42 ± 17 h(-1)) than non-REM (NREM) sleep (14 ± 5 h(-1)) in obese mice (P < 0.05), but rates were not different between lean and obese mice in either sleep state. Even after experimentally enhancing central apnea generation by acute withdrawal of hypoxic chemoreceptor activation during sleep, central apnea rates remained comparable between lean and obese mice. Last, we were unable to detect patterns of diaphragmatic burst activity suggestive of obstructive apnea events in obese mice. In summary, obesity does not predispose mice to increased occurrence of central or obstructive apneas during sleep, but does lead to a more pronounced circadian variability in respiration."

This study compares breathing disorders and their effect on sleep of normal weighted and obese OSAS patients. The main sleep parameters of 32 normal weighted OSAS patients (body mass index, BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) were compared with those of 32 obese OSAS patients (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2) with a virtually equal apnea-hypopnea index (AHI ± 3). The mean AHI in both groups was 27.9/h (BMI ≤ 25 kg/m2) and 28.0/h (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), respectively. Sleep efficiency, relative percentages of sleep phases S1-S4 and REM, mean, minimal and maximal heart rate were not significantly different in statistic analysis in normal weighted and obese patients. Normal weighted OSAS patients had a higher apnea index (11.4 vs. 6.4, p=0.040), a higher minimal (81.3% vs. 71.7, p=0.003) and mean (94.9% vs. 92.8%, p=0.007) oxygen saturation, but a smaller hypopnea index (16.5 vs. 21.6, p=0.047) and a lower index of snoring (175.2 vs. 394.1, p<0.001) than their obese counterparts. In OSAS patients with an equal AHI, the obese have fewer apneas, but more hypopneas, and a lower minimal oxygen saturation than normal weighted patients. The effect of OSAS on the sleep architecture, however, seems not to be associated with the patients' body weight."

This study sought to reveal the association of multiple adiposity indicators with OSA risk. This cross-sectional study included 9,733 participants aged 35-74 years, recruited from an ongoing population-based cohort. OSA was assessed by the Berlin Questionnaire. Six adiposity indicators, including neck circumference (NC), body fat percentage (BF%), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), visceral adiposity index (VAI), lipid accumulation product (LAP), and resting metabolic rate (RMR), were selected. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association of adiposity indicators with OSA risk. One thousand six hundred twenty-six participants (16.71%) were classified into the OSA group. NC, BF%, WHR, VAI, LAP, and RMR were all positively associated with the risk of OSA after adjusting for confounders, regardless of age, sex, and history of dyslipidemia. Every 1-unit increment of NC, BF%, and VAI was associated with a 13%, 9%, and 14% increased risk of OSA, respectively; every 0.01-unit increment of WHR was associated with a 3% increased risk of OSA; every 10-unit increment of LAP and RMR was associated with 2% and 4% increased risk of OSA, respectively. NC, BF%, WHR, VAI, LAP, and RMR were all independently and positively associated with OSA risk, regardless of age, sex, history of dyslipidemia, and menopausal status. Application of these new indicators could help to more comprehensively reflect and predict the risk of OSA in the general population."

Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children as well as adults. Obese children may be at increased risk for persistent OSA following adenotonsillectomy treatment for OSA. Severe obesity and OSA may lead to the obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, with hypoxia, hypercapnia, and reduced ventilatory drive.

Fibroblasts and immune cells are widely known to be attracted to and modified by cancer cells. However, the role of pericytes in the tumor microenvironment beyond endothelium stabilization is poorly understood. Here, we report that pericytes promoted colorectal cancer (CRC) cell proliferation, migration, invasion, stemness, and chemoresistance in vitro, as well as tumor growth in a xenograft CRC model. We demonstrate that coculture with human CRC cells induced broad transcriptomic changes in pericytes, mostly associated with TGF-β receptor activation. The prognostic value of a TGF-β response signature in pericytes was analyzed in CRC patient data sets. This signature was found to be a good predictor of CRC relapse. Moreover, in response to stimulation by CRC cells, pericytes expressed high levels of TGF-β1, initiating an autocrine activation loop. Investigation of secreted mediators and underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that IGFBP-3 is a key paracrine factor from activated pericytes affecting CRC cell migration and invasion. In summary, we demonstrate that the interplay between pericytes and CRC cells triggers a vicious cycle that stimulates pericyte cytokine secretion, in turn increasing CRC cell tumorigenic properties. Overall, we provide another example of how cancer cells can manipulate the tumor microenvironment."

          "abstract": "Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are activated fibroblasts constituting the major stromal components in many types of cancer. CAFs contribute to hallmarks of cancer such as proliferation, invasion and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and are associated with poor prognosis of patients with cancer. However, in glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and aggressive primary malignant brain tumor, our knowledge about CAFs or CAF-like stromal cells is limited. Here, using commonly accepted CAF markers, we characterized CAF-like cell populations in clinical glioma specimens and datasets along with mouse models of GBM. We found that tumor-associated pericytes marked by co-expression of fibroblast activation protein α (FAP) and PDGFRβ represent major stromal cell subsets in both human GBM and mouse GBM models, while a fraction of mesenchymal neoplastic cells also express FAP in patient tumors. Since oncolytic viruses can kill cancer cells and simultaneously modulate the tumor microenvironment by impacting non-neoplastic populations such as immune cells and tumor vasculature, we further investigated the ability of oncolytic viruses to target GBM-associated stromal cells. An oncolytic adenovirus, ICOVIR15, carrying ∆24-E1A and an RGD-fiber, infects and depletes FAP+ pericytes as well as GBM cells in murine GBM. Our study thus identifies FAP+/PDGFRβ+ pericytes as a major CAF-like stromal cell population in GBM, and highlights the unique property of this oncolytic adenovirus to target both GBM cells and GBM-associated stromal FAP+ cells."

In particular, the role of vascular pericytes, a critical cellular component in the TME, in cancer invasion and metastasis warrants further investigation. Here, we report that an elevation of FGF-2 signaling in samples from patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and xenograft mouse models promoted NPC metastasis. Mechanistically, tumor cell-derived FGF-2 strongly promoted pericyte proliferation and pericyte-specific expression of an orphan chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 14 (CXCL14) via FGFR1/AHR signaling. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments validated that pericyte-derived CXCL14 promoted macrophage recruitment and polarization toward an M2-like phenotype. Genetic knockdown of FGF2 or genetic depletion of tumoral pericytes blocked CXCL14 expression and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration. Pharmacological inhibition of TAMs by clodronate liposome treatment resulted in a reduction of FGF-2-induced pulmonary metastasis. Together, these findings shed light on the inflammatory role of tumoral pericytes in promoting TAM-mediated metastasis. We provide mechanistic insight into an FGF-2/FGFR1/pericyte/CXCL14/TAM stromal communication axis in NPC and propose an effective antimetastasis therapy concept by targeting a pericyte-derived inflammation for NPC or FGF-2hi tumors."

However, studies over the past few decades have demonstrated that cancer is a vastly complex entity with multiple components affecting a tumour's growth, invasion and metastasis. These components, collectively termed the 'tumour microenvironment', include endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, leucocytes and elements of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Biological agents that target components of the tumour microenvironment may provide an interesting alternative to traditional tumour cell-directed therapy. Because of the complexity of the tumour milieu, the most beneficial therapy will likely involve the combination of one or more agents directed at this new target. This review highlights recent preclinical and clinical studies involving agents that target tumour vasculature, leucocytes, pericytes, cancer-associated fibroblasts and ECM components. We pay particular attention to combination therapies targeting multiple components of the tumour microenvironment, and aim to demonstrate that this strategy holds promise for the future of cancer treatment."

Their <i>milieu</i> acquires specific properties thanks to intense crosstalk between stromal and cancer cells, leading to a vicious circle. Fibroblasts, pericytes, lymphocytes and tumor associated-macrophages orchestrate most of the biological pathways. In epithelial ovarian cancer, high rates of activated pericytes determine a poorer prognosis, defining a common signature promoting ovarian cancer proliferation, local invasion and distant spread. Mesenchymal cells also release chemokines and cytokines under hormonal influence, such as estrogens that drive most of the endometrial cancers. Interestingly, the architecture of the cervical cancer <i>milieu</i> is shaped by the synergy of high-risk Human Papilloma Virus oncoproteins and the activity of stromal estrogen receptor α. Lymphocytes represent a shield against cancer cells but some cell subpopulation could lead to immunosuppression, tumor growth and dissemination. Cytotoxic tumor infiltrating lymphocytes can be eluded by over-adapted cancer cells in a scenario of immune-tolerance driven by T-regulatory cells. Therefore, the tumor microenvironment has a high translational potential offering many targets for biological and immunological therapies."

Here we show that PDGF-BB induces pericyte-fibroblast transition (PFT), which significantly contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that PDGF-BB-PDGFRβ signaling promotes PFT both in vitro and in in vivo tumors. Genome-wide expression analysis indicates that PDGF-BB-activated pericytes acquire mesenchymal progenitor features. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of PDGFRβ ablate the PDGF-BB-induced PFT. Genetic tracing of pericytes with two independent mouse strains, TN-AP-CreERT2:R26R-tdTomato and NG2-CreERT2:R26R-tdTomato, shows that PFT cells gain stromal fibroblast and myofibroblast markers in tumors. Importantly, coimplantation of PFT cells with less-invasive tumor cells in mice markedly promotes tumor dissemination and invasion, leading to an increased number of circulating tumor cells and metastasis. Our findings reveal a mechanism of vascular pericytes in PDGF-BB-promoted cancer invasion and metastasis by inducing PFT, and thus targeting PFT may offer a new treatment option of cancer metastasis."

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal disease that often results in a poor prognosis. Unlike most solid tumors, GBM is characterized by diffuse infiltrating margins, extensive angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, and clonal heterogeneity. Recurrent disease is an unavoidable consequence for many patients as standard treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have proven to be insufficient in causing long-term survival benefits. Systemic delivery of promising drugs is hindered due to the blood-brain barrier and non-uniform perfusion within GBM tissue. In recent years, many investigations have highlighted the role of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment in the initiation and maintenance of tumor tissue. Preclinical and early clinical studies to target GSCs and microenvironmental components are currently underway. Of these strategies, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and redirected cytotoxic T cells have shown promising results in early investigations. But, GBM microenvironment is heterogenous and recent investigations have shown cell populations within this microenvironment to be plastic. These studies underline the importance of identifying the role of and targeting multiple cell populations within the GBM microenvironment which could have a synergistic effect when combined with novel therapies. Pericytes are multipotent perivascular cells that play a vital role within the GBM microenvironment by assisting in tumor initiation, survival, and progression. Due to their role in regulating the blood-brain barrier permeability, promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, clearing extracellular matrix for infiltrating GBM cells and in helping GBM cells evade immune surveillance, pericytes could be ideal therapeutic targets for stymieing or exploiting their role within the GBM microenvironment. This chapter will introduce hallmarks of GBM and elaborate on the contributions of pericytes to these hallmarks by examining recent findings. In addition, the chapter also highlights the therapeutic value of targeting pericytes, while discussing conventional and novel GBM therapies and obstacles to their efficacy."

The process of bone metastasis is regulated by the dynamic crosstalk between metastatic cancer cells, cellular components of the bone marrow microenvironment (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes), and the bone matrix. The feed-forward loop mechanisms governs the co-option of homeostatic bone remodeling by cancer cells in bone. Recent developments have highlighted the discovery of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their diverse roles in distant outgrowths. Several studies have implicated EV-mediated interactions between cancer cells and the bone microenvironment in synergistically promoting pathological skeletal metabolism in the metastatic site. Nevertheless, the potential role that EVs serve in arbitrating intricate sequences of coordinated events within the bone microenvironment remains an emerging field. In this chapter, we review the role of cellular participants and molecular mechanisms in regulating normal bone physiology and explore the progress of current research into bone-derived EVs in directly triggering and coordinating the processes of physiological bone remodeling. In view of the emerging role of EVs in interorgan crosstalk, this review also highlights the multiple systemic pathophysiological processes orchestrated by the EVs to direct organotropism in bone in prostate cancer. Given the deleterious consequences of bone metastasis and its clinical importance, in-depth knowledge of the multifarious role of EVs in distant organ metastasis is expected to open new possibilities for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic intervention for advanced bone metastatic prostate cancer."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to compare blood-oxygen-level-dependent response in 18 female adolescents with bulimia nervosa and 18 healthy female age-matched subjects during performance on a Simon spatial incompatibility task. Bayesian analyses were used to compare the two groups on patterns of brain activation during correct responses to conflict stimuli and to explore the effects of antecedent stimulus context on group differences in self-regulation and conflict resolution. Adolescents with and without bulimia nervosa performed similarly on the task. During correct responses in conflict trials, frontostriatal circuits-including the right inferolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and putamen-failed to activate to the same degree in adolescents with bulimia nervosa as in healthy comparison subjects. Instead, deactivation was seen in the left inferior frontal gyrus as well as a neural system encompassing the posterior cingulate cortex and superior frontal gyrus. Group differences in cortical and striatal regions were driven by the differential responses to stimuli preceded by conflict and nonconflict stimuli, respectively. When engaging the self-regulatory control processes necessary to resolve conflict, adolescents with bulimia nervosa displayed abnormal patterns of activation in frontostriatal and default-mode systems. Their abnormal processing of the antecedent stimulus context conditioned their brain response to conflict differently from that of healthy comparison subjects, specifically in frontal regions. It is suspected that functional disturbances in frontal portions of frontostriatal systems may release feeding behaviors from regulatory control, thereby perpetuating the conflicting desires to consume fattening foods and avoid weight gain that characterize bulimia nervosa."

The main benefits of peer mediation are in developing children's mediation teaching style and cognitive modifiability. The peer mediation developed recently is based on Vygotsky's sociocultural and Feuerstein's mediated learning experience theories. The main objectives of the study were to investigate the effects of the Peer Mediation with Young Children (PMYC) programme on children's cognitive modifiability of mediators and learners and to study the effects of cognitive level of the learner and mediator on their cognitive modifiability following the programme. A sample of 178 pupils (89 mediators in Grade 3 and 89 learners in Grade 1) was randomly assigned to experimental (N=43 dyads) and control (N=46 dyads) groups. The mediators in the experimental group participated in the PMYC programme, whereas the mediators in the control group received a substitute intervention aimed at emphasizing general conditions of peer interaction. Following the intervention, mediators of both groups received a demonstration of a multimedia programme as a preparation for the peer mediation interaction and later taught it to their young counterparts. Following the teaching session (e.g. teaching of seriation problems), mediators in both groups were given a dynamic assessment measure of analogies. The learners however were given a test of seriation before and after the intervention. The findings showed that following the intervention the experimental mediators showed higher level of analogies scores, as well as higher improvement on the dynamic analogies measure as compared with control mediators. The experimental learners showed higher pre- to post-intervention achievements on the seriation problems as compared with control learners. The findings showed also that when there was a match between the mediator and learner's cognitive level (i.e. low-low or high-high) the differences between the experimental and control groups were minor and negligible. However, when the mediator-learner cognitive levels did not match, the experimental learners received higher scores than the control learners. Mediators in the experimental group had to cope with the incongruent cognitive level by facilitating their mediational approach and consequently enhancing the learner's performance. The findings are discussed in regard to Piaget, Vygotsky and Feuerstein's theories and recent research on peer assisted learning."

They show that Hippo signaling normally maintains the cardiac fibroblast in a resting state and, conversely, its inactivation during disease-related stress results in a spontaneous transition toward a myofibroblast state that underlies fibrosis and ventricular remodeling.

Meaning made was measured using the Grief and Meaning Reconstruction Inventory (GMRI) as well as using the Integration of Stressful Life Experiences-Short Form (ISLES-SF). At a 7-10-months follow-up (n = 171) symptoms of PGD were assessed. The mean age at the second assessment point was 44.3 years (SD = 16.1) and the majority of the sample identified as female (71.9%). Process analysis was employed to test a series of simple mediation models. When the GMRI was used as a measure of meaning, the indirect effect of each risk factor on PGD symptoms, as mediated by meaning made, was significant (95% CI). When the ISLES-SF was used to measure meaning, the indirect effect of each risk factor with the exception of violent loss was significant (95% CI). The study demonstrates that meaning making serves to mediate the adverse impact of multiple PGD risk factors on the development of PGD symptomatology. Specifically, the study suggests that PGD risk factors exacerbate symptoms of PGD by impeding the meaning-making process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)."

          "abstract": "Interest in studying mechanisms of behavior change (MOBCs) in substance use disorder (SUD) treatments has grown considerably in the past two decades. Much of this work has focused on identifying which variables statistically mediate the effect of SUD treatments on clinical outcomes. However, a fuller conceptualization of MOBCs will require greater understanding of questions that extend beyond traditional mediation analysis, including better understanding of when MOBCs change during treatment, when they are most critical to aiding the initiation or maintenance of change, and how MOBCs themselves arise as a function of treatment processes. In the present study, we review why these MOBC-related questions are often minimally addressed in empirical research and provide examples of data analytic methods that may address these issues. We highlight several recent studies that have used such methods and discuss how these methods can provide unique theoretical insights and actionable clinical information. Several statistical approaches can enhance the field's understanding of the timing and development of MOBCs, including growth-curve modeling, time-varying effect modeling, moderated mediation analysis, dynamic systems modeling, and simulation methods. Adopting greater diversity in methods for modeling MOBCs will help researchers better understand the timing and development of key change variables and will expand the theoretical precision and clinical impact of MOBC research. Advances in research design, measurement, and technology are key to supporting these advances."

          "abstract": "The clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited due to its systemic side effects and drug resistance. Recent evidence suggests that metformin prevents and controls certain but not all types of cancer. The beneficial use of metformin in combination with some chemotherapeutic agents has been reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of metformin on DOX-induced effects in human prostate DU145 cancer cells and clarify its molecular mechanisms. For this purpose, DU145 cells were treated with DOX or metformin, either alone or in combination with each other. The proliferation of DU145 cells was inhibited by DOX-alone and metformin-alone treatment in a time and dose-dependent manner. Metformin could enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX by increasing DOX cellular uptake and cell cycle arrest at G1/S checkpoint which is associated with the enhancement of p21 protein expression. Moreover, metformin could elevate DOX-induced apoptosis in DU145 cells in a concentration-dependent manner and DOX-induced caspase-3 activity. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of metformin with DOX potentiates the anticancer efficacy of DOX in DU145 cells via inhibiting ABCB1 function, cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition and apoptosis induction."

Sixty-four children aged 3-7 (M = 5.58, SD = 1.28) were presented with a Conservation of Liquid task assessing their Cognitive Development (specifically Concrete Operational Skills), a false-belief task to measure possession of Belief-Desire Theory of Mind, and a task measuring the ability to acknowledge multiple possibilities. The ability to elaborate on potential negative outcomes was assessed using a Worry Elaboration task. Mediation analysis revealed that all three variables significantly mediated the relationship between Age and Worry Elaboration.

          "abstract": "Peak age at onset of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is between 20 and 50 years, although SSc is also described in both young and elderly patients. We conducted the present study to determine if age at disease onset modulates the clinical characteristics and outcome of SSc patients. The Spanish Scleroderma Study Group recruited 1037 patients with a mean follow-up of 5.2 ± 6.8 years. Based on the mean ± 1 standard deviation (SD) of age at disease onset (45 ± 15 yr) of the whole series, patients were classified into 3 groups: age ≤ 30 years (early onset), age between 31 and 59 years (standard onset), and age ≥ 60 years (late onset). We compared initial and cumulative manifestations, immunologic features, and death rates. The early-onset group included 195 patients; standard-onset group, 651; and late-onset, 191 patients. The early-onset group had a higher prevalence of esophageal involvement (72% in early-onset compared with 67% in standard-onset and 56% in late-onset; p = 0.004), and myositis (11%, 7.2%, and 2.9%, respectively; p = 0.009), but a lower prevalence of centromere antibodies (33%, 46%, and 47%, respectively; p = 0.007). In contrast, late-onset SSc was characterized by a lower prevalence of digital ulcers (54%, 41%, and 34%, respectively; p < 0.001) but higher rates of heart conduction system abnormalities (9%, 13%, and 21%, respectively; p = 0.004). Pulmonary hypertension was found in 25% of elderly patients and in 12% of the youngest patients (p = 0.010). After correction for the population effects of age and sex, standardized mortality ratio was shown to be higher in younger patients. The results of the present study confirm that age at disease onset is associated with differences in clinical presentation and outcome in SSc patients."

Retrospective analysis of case records of patients with systemic sclerosis, having age of onset less than 16 years and seen at our hospital from 1988 to 2004, was done. Patients with linear scleroderma and morphea were excluded. There were 23 patients (19 girls, 4 boys) with median age of onset of 12 years (range 5-16 years). The median age at presentation was 17 years (range 10-34 years). The median time from first symptoms to presentation was 4 years (range 0.2-26 years). Among these, 14 had diffuse systemic sclerosis (DSSc), while 9 had limited scleroderma (LSSc). The clinical features seen at presentation in patients were: Raynaud's phenomenon in 19, digital ulcers in 14, loss of finger tip pulp in 12, reflux in 8, dysphagia in 7, arthritis in 8, digital gangrene in 2, and pulmonary artery hypertension in 1. Antinuclear antibody was positive in 15 out of 18 patients tested. Interstitial lung disease was seen in 15 patients, 6 of whom had diffuse disease. The median skin score was 22 (range 7-48) . One patient died of primary pulmonary hypertension within 1 year of onset of symptoms. At a mean follow-up of 34 months, 14 patients were stable or had improvement in skin score or dyspnea on exertion. DSSc and LSSc in childhood have a clinical presentation similar to adult patients, with cardiopulmonary involvement being the major predictor of outcome. The short-term prognosis of JSSc is good."

There is controversial evidence on whether/how the age at disease onset affects their clinical phenotype. We here investigate the relationship between age at disease onset and symptoms in a large cohort of SSc patients (lcSSc, dcSSc and SSc-overlap syndromes). Clinical data of the registry of the German Network for Systemic Scleroderma including 3281 patients were evaluated and subdivided into three age groups at disease onset (<40 years, 40-60 years, >60 years). Among all SSc patients, 24.5% developed their first non-Raynaud phenomenon symptoms at the age <40 years, and 22.5% were older than 60 years of age. In particular, older patients at onset developed the lcSSc subset significantly more often. Furthermore, they had pulmonary hypertension more often, but digital ulcerations less often. Remarkably, the course of the disease was more rapidly progressing in the older cohort (>60 years), except for gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal involvement. No significant difference was found for the use of corticosteroids. However, significantly, fewer patients older than 60 years received immunosuppressive treatment. In this large registry, ∼25% of patients developed SSc at an age above 60 years with an increased frequency of lcSSc. In this age group, an onset of internal organ involvement was significantly accelerated across all three subsets. These findings suggest that, in the elderly cohort, more frequent follow-up examinations are required for an earlier detection of organ complications."

Demographic data of the patients, organ involvement and outcome of the disease were examined using the Minimal Essential Data Set database system. From 5000 patients in the EUSTAR cohort, 60 patients (1.2%) with jSSc and 910 patients (18%) with aSSc were selected according the inclusion criteria. In the jSSc group, the mean age of disease onset was 12.4 years (range 2-15.9 years), and in the aSSc group, the mean age was 32 years (range 20-40 years). Disease subsets were similar. The antibody profile was also comparable except for ACAs, which were positive in 5% of the jSSc group and 26.9% of the aSSc group (P<0.005). Organ involvement (lung, kidney, joint, muscle and heart) was similar in the two groups of patients at the time of the last follow-up. The subset distribution in the jSSc and aSSc cohorts was found to be similar. Only the frequency of ACAs was significantly lower in the jSSc, which supports the hypothesis that the SSc patients with paediatric onset in the adult cohort may represent a distinct subgroup of the complete cohort of paediatric patients."

Patients were divided into those with childhood onset (first SSc symptom or finding before age 16 yrs) and those with early adult and late adult onset. The 3 groups were compared with respect to disease classification, clinical, laboratory and serologic data, and survival. One hundred eleven childhood onset SSc cases seen between 1960 and 2003 were compared with 2559 adult onset SSc cases (1087 with onset age 16-40 and 1472 with onset after age 40 yrs) first evaluated between 1972 and 2001. Age distribution at onset was unimodal, suggesting that childhood disease is part of the spectrum of adult onset SSc. A significantly greater proportion of childhood onset patients had overlap syndromes, most frequently with polymyositis-dermatomyositis (PM-DM), and skeletal muscle involvement. Children with diffuse cutaneous (dc) SSc had significantly lower maximum mean total skin thickness scores than adult patients with dcSSc. Renal involvement was uncommon in childhood onset cases, and the frequency increased with age of onset. Serum anti-PM-Scl and anti-U1RNP antibodies were detected significantly more frequently in childhood than in adult onset cases. In contrast, anti-RNA polymerase III and anticentromere antibodies were found significantly more frequently in adults. Survival was significantly better among childhood than all adult onset cases combined, but similar to survival in young adult onset SSc cases. Scleroderma heart disease was a frequent cause of death among children with SSc. Patients with juvenile onset SSc more frequently have an overlap syndrome with PM-DM, higher frequency of skeletal muscle involvement, serum anti-PM-Scl and anti-U1RNP antibody, fatal cardiac disease, and improved survival compared with adult onset SSc cases."

In total, 2300 patients with SSc were evaluated between 1990 and 2009 and reviewed from a university-based scleroderma center cohort. Demographic profile, SSc subtype, autoantibody status, Medsger severity scores, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and right heart catheterization measures were compared between late-age onset vs younger-age onset patients with SSc. Overall, 2084 patients (91%) developed SSc prior to age 65, while 216 (9%) were ≥ 65 years. Late-age onset patients had a significantly higher proportion of anticentromere antibodies (42% vs 27%; p = 0.001) compared to early-age onset patients. Risk of pulmonary hypertension (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.00, 3.12), muscle weakness (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.30, 1.64), renal impairment (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.98, 4.04), and cardiac disease (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.92, 3.78) was greater among those with late-age onset SSc; although risk of digital ischemia (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47, 0.86) was reduced. The cumulative incidence of pulmonary hypertension at 5 years was greater among those with late-age onset SSc (9%) compared to those with early-age onset SSc (2.7%; log-rank, p < 0.001). These findings suggest that older patients with SSc are at greater risk for pulmonary hypertension, renal impairment, cardiac disease, and muscle weakness. Awareness of the distinct risk for specific organ manifestations in SSc, in particular pulmonary hypertension, should guide the care of patients with SSc whose disease begins after age 65."

Myelination of the CNS requires the generation of functionally mature OLs from OPCs. OLs are the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. Microglia play both beneficial and detrimental roles during myelin damage and repair. Astrocyte is responsible for myelin formation and regeneration by direct interaction with oligodendrocyte lineage cells. These glial cells are influenced by experience-dependent activities such as environmental enrichment (EE). To date, there are few studies that have investigated the association between EE and glial cells. EE with a complex combination of sensorimotor, cognitive, and social stimulation has a significant effect on cognitive impairment and brain plasticity. Hence, one mechanism through EE improving cognitive function may rely on the mutual effect of EE and glial cells. The purpose of this paper is to review recent research into the efficacy of EE for myelination and glial cells at cellular and molecular levels and offers critical insights for future research directions of EE and the treatment of EE in cognitive impairment disease."

Oligodendrocytes in the CNS and Schwann cells in the PNS are the glial cells responsible for generating the myelin sheath. Myelination requires the production of a vast amount of proteins and lipid-rich membrane, which puts a heavy load on the secretory pathway of myelinating glia and leaves them susceptible to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Cells respond to ER stress by activating the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is initially protective but in situations of prolonged unresolved stress the UPR can lead to the apoptotic death of the stressed cell. There is strong evidence that ER stress and the UPR play a role in a number of disorders of myelin and myelinating glia, including multiple sclerosis, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, Vanishing White Matter Disease, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. In this review we discuss the role that ER stress and the UPR play in these disorders of myelin. In addition, we discuss the progress that has been made in our understanding of the effect genetic and pharmacological manipulation of the UPR has in mouse models of these disorders and the novel therapeutic potential of targeting the UPR that these studies support.

Glial cells responsible for myelination in the CNS might be the target cells of this type of damage. Glial cells with stem cell properties derived from the perinatal and adult rat CNS can be cultured in vitro. These cells are able to differentiate into oligodendrocytes or type-2 astrocytes (O-2A) depending on the culture conditions. Growth factors produced by monolayers of type-1 astrocytes inhibit premature differentiation of O-2A progenitor cells and allow colony formation. A method which employs these monolayers of type-1 astrocytes to culture O-2A progenitor cells has been adapted to allow the analysis of colonies of surviving cells after X-irradiation. In vitro survival curves were obtained for glial progenitor cells derived from perinatal and adult optic nerves. The intrinsic radiosensitivity of perinatal and adult O-2A progenitor cells showed a large difference. Perinatal O-2A progenitor cells are quite radiosensitive, in contrast to adult O-2A progenitor cells. For both cell types an inverse relationship was found between the dose and the size of colonies derived from surviving cells. Surviving O-2A progenitor cells maintain their ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes or type-2 astrocytes. This system to assess radiation-induced damage to glial progenitor cells in vitro seems to have a great potential in unraveling the cellular basis of radiation-induced demyelinating syndromes of the CNS."

          "abstract": "Oligodendrocytes are the glial cells responsible for the formation of myelin around axons of the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin is an insulating layer that allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along neurons. If myelin is damaged, as in chronic demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these impulses slow down. Remyelination by oligodendrocytes is often ineffective in MS, in part because of the failure of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to differentiate into mature, myelinating oligodendrocytes. The process of oligodendrocyte differentiation is tightly controlled by several regulatory networks involving transcription factors, intracellular signaling pathways, and extrinsic cues. Understanding the factors that regulate oligodendrocyte development is essential for the discovery of new therapeutic strategies capable of enhancing remyelination. Over the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of oligodendrocyte development, exerting effects on cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and myelination. This article will review the role of miRNAs on oligodendrocyte biology and discuss their potential as promising therapeutic tools for remyelination."

The development of myelin requires tight coordination for the cell to deliver lipid and protein building blocks to specific myelin segments at the right time. Both internal and external cues control myelination, thus the reception of these signals also requires precise regulation. In late years, a growing body of evidence indicates that oligodendrocytes, like many other cell types, may use extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a medium for transferring information. The field of EV research has expanded rapidly over the past decade, with new contributions that suggest EVs might have direct involvement in communications with neurons and other glial cells to fine tune oligodendroglial function. This functional role of EVs might also be maladaptive, as it has likewise been implicated in the spreading of toxic molecules within the brain during disease.

Adhesion G protein-coupled receptor ADGRG1 (GPR56) is expressed in all major glial cells and regulates a wide variety of physiological processes by mediating cell-cell and cell-matrix communications. Previous literature has demonstrated the requirement of ADGRG1 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) during developmental myelination. However, it is unknown if ADGRG1 is responsible for myelin formation in a cell-type-specific manner. To that end, here we profiled myelin status in response to deletion of Adgrg1 specifically in OPCs, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. Interestingly, we find that knocking out Adgrg1 in OPCs significantly decreases OPC proliferation and reduced number of myelinated axons. However, deleting Adgrg1 in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons does not impact developmental myelination. These data support an autonomous functional role for Adgrg1 in OPCs related to myelination."

          "abstract": "Myelin is a proteolipid sheath enwrapping axons in the nervous system that facilitates signal transduction along the axons. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes are specialized glial cells responsible for myelin formation and maintenance. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), oligodendroglia cell death and myelin damage (demyelination) cause chronic axonal damage and irreparable loss of sensory and motor functions. Accumulating evidence shows that replacement of damaged oligodendrocytes and renewal of myelin (remyelination) are promising approaches to prevent axonal degeneration and restore function following SCI. Neural precursor cells (NPCs) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are two main resident cell populations in the spinal cord with innate capacities to foster endogenous oligodendrocyte replacement and remyelination. However, due to the hostile microenvironment of SCI, the regenerative capacity of these endogenous precursor cells is conspicuously restricted. Activated resident glia, along with infiltrating immune cells, are among the key modulators of secondary injury mechanisms that create a milieu impermissible to oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination. Recent studies have uncovered inhibitory roles for astrocyte-associated molecules such as matrix chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), and a plethora of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic factors produced by activated microglia/macrophages. The quality of axonal remyelination is additionally challenged by dysregulation of the supportive growth factors required for maturation of new oligodendrocytes and axo-oligodendrocyte signalling. Careful understanding of factors that modulate the activity of endogenous precursor cells in the injury microenvironment is a key step in developing efficient repair strategies for remyelination and functional recovery following SCI."

          "abstract": "Myelin sheaths are crucial for the survival and maintenance of the axons and the rapid propagation of the action potential. The glial cells involved are Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). One oligodendrocyte may myelinate over 40 axons. In the CNS, myelin is composed of several layers of cytoplasmic membrane from oligodendrocytes stabilized by structural myelin-specific proteins such as proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP). Those genes are expressed during myelination and then silenced. They can be re-expressed after demyelinating episodes, where they contribute to remyelination. Demyelination occurs after injuries of the CNS such as traumatic brain injury or during acute episodes of neurodegeneration observed in demyelinating and neurodegenerative diseases. Remyelination process is achieved by oligodendrocytes newly generated following the recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Failure of remyelination process leads to irreversible axonal loss, functional impairment, and finally decreased cognitive performances. Several techniques have been described to study myelination and remyelination in culture systems. In this chapter, we explain how we can study myelin genes' expression in oligodendrocytes by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using specific primers for plp and mbp. This technique can be crucial and prompt to determine the effect of specific chemicals (such as pesticides) on the myelination process in oligodendrocytes."

          "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine the genetic structure and variability of Bionda Piemontese and Bianca di Saluzzo (Piedmont, Northwest Italy) using an international set of microsatellite loci (AVIANDIV-FAO). Differences compared with commercial lines and other Italian breeds were verified to justify the implementation of conservation programmes. Flock contribution to genetic variability was assessed following the approach implemented in the MolKin software. Comparison was performed using the fixation index and the Reynolds genetic distance. The most likely number of different populations was estimated using the clustering procedure implemented in STRUCTURE. The molecular information suggests that management practices could have prevented random mating and produced inbreeding and heterogeneity across flocks. In this respect, Bionda and Bianca show substructuring and are more similar to British breeds than other continental European breeds. Bionda and Bianca fit into the European breeds provided with the highest number of alleles and expected heterozygosity. There is a clear distinction between the Piedmont breeds and the other populations. The Piedmont poultry differ from both commercial lines and other Italian breeds and retain a high level of genetic variability. As for other indigenous breeds, Bionda and Bianca could make an original contribution to the industry in the future. A collective planned approach to restoration is essential, because the flocks are managed with poor regulation. Enhancing connection between breeders with an efficient replacement interchange and mating plan is the right way of controlling inbreeding, preventing substructuring and increasing variability within the flocks."

          "abstract": "The aim of investigation was to evaluate a traceability system to detect industrial chicken meat among indigenous products, considering issues that could affect assignment accuracy. The dataset included 2 Italian indigenous meat breeds, namely Bionda Piemontese (2 ecotypes) and Bianca di Saluzzo, one broiler line, and 3 layer lines. Assignment tests were performed using a standard panel of 28 microsatellite loci. To evaluate effects of inbreeding and substructure on assignment accuracy, a simulated dataset was prepared. Broilers and layers belong to homogeneous populations and never enter the clusters of indigenous breeds. Ambiguity or misallocation are expected between the Bionda ecotypes and between the 2 indigenous breeds, but it is unlikely that niche products provided by Bionda and Bianca will compete with one another. Non-random mating reduces accuracy, but only populations having weak genetic differentiation are involved, namely those that are less interesting to discriminate. The dataset can be used as a reference population to distinguish commercial meat from indigenous meat with great accuracy. Misallocations increase as number of loci decreases, but only within or between the indigenous breeds. A subpanel of the most resolving 14 loci keeps sufficient informative content to provide accuracy and to correctly allocate additional test samples within the reference population. This analytical tool is economically sustainable as a method to detect fraud or mislabeling. Adoption of a monitoring system should increase the value of typical products because the additional burden of molecular analyses would improve commercial grade and perception of quality."

This soil-borne necrotrophic fungal pathogen causes significant economic losses in worldwide lettuce production annually. Furthermore, current methods utilized for management and combatting the disease, such as biocontrol, are insufficient. In this study, three cultivars of lettuce (one Crispy and two Leafy cultivars of red and green lettuce) were grown in central Poland (Lodz Voivodeship), a widely known Polish horticultural region. In the summer and early autumn, lettuce cultivars were grown in control and <i>S. sclerotiorum</i>-infected fields. The lettuce cultivars (<i>Templin</i>, <i>Lollo Rossa</i>, and <i>Lollo Bionda</i>) differed phenotypically and in terms of the survival of the fungal infection. The Crispy iceberg <i>Templin</i> was the most susceptible to <i>S. sclerotiorum</i> infection compared to the other cultivars during both vegetation seasons. The total content of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, and anthocyanins varied among cultivars and fluctuated during infection. Moreover, phenolic content was affected by vegetation season with alterable environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, soil temperature, and pH. The most increased levels of phenolics, both flavonoids and anthocyanins in infected plants, were observed in the Leafy red <i>Lollo Rossa</i> cultivar in both crops. However, the highest survival/resistance to the fungus was noticed for <i>Lollo Rossa</i> in the summer crop and <i>Lollo Bionda</i> in the autumn crop."

          "abstract": "Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers were used to investigate the genetic variation in a sample of seven goat (Capra hircus) populations. A total of 210 individuals (30 per population) were analysed using seven selected AFLP primer combinations that produced 219 clear polymorphisms. Four autochthonous goat breeds (Bionda dell'Adamello, Frisa, Orobica and Verzaschese), two primary populations, one from the Lombardy Alps (Val di Livo) and the other from Sardinia island (Sarda) and a reference cosmopolitan breed (Saanen) were included in the analysis. The expected heterozygosity (Het) did not differ significantly among breeds (range 0.21-0.24). No breed specific markers were identified. The variability at AFLP loci was largely maintained within breeds, as indicated by the coefficient of genetic differentiation (Gst) value (0.11). Dice similarities calculated between pairs of individuals belonging to the same or to different breeds largely overlapped. Bootstrapping on markers indicated that the coefficient of variation (CV) of the genetic indexes tested decreases only marginally by adding markers over 100 AFLPs. Cluster analysis based on standard genetic distance between breeds indicates that Sarda is the most distant population, while Bionda, Frisa, Verzaschese and Val di Livo seem to be highly related populations. Interestingly, Saanen is closer than Orobica to the other four goat populations of the Lombardy Alps. Principal co-ordinates analysis based on Dice similarities confirms these observations. Genetic diversity of the goat populations investigated confirms what is expected on the basis of their geographical location. Results from Orobica are not correlated with geographical distances and may reflect undocumented migrations and gene flows and identify an original genetic resource."

Two AM fungi species (Funneliformis mosseae and Claroideoglomus lamellosum) isolated from the hyper-arid Atacama Desert (northern Chile) were inoculated to two lettuce cultivars (Grand Rapids and Lollo Bionda), and watered with 0 and 60 mM NaCl. At 60 days of plant growth, the AM symbiotic development, biomass production, nutrient content (Pi, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>), physiological parameters, gene expressions of ion channels and transporters (NHX and HKT1), and aquaporins proteins abundance (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) were evaluated. Salinity increased the AM root colonization by both inocula. AM lettuce plants showed an improved growth, increased relative water content and improved of K/Na ratio in root. In Grand Rapids cultivar, the high efficiency of photosystem II was higher than Lollo Bionda cultivar; on the contrary, stomatal conductance was higher in Lollo Bionda. Nevertheless, both parameters were increased by AM colonization. In the same way, LsaHKT1;1, LsaHKT1;6, LsaNHX2, LsaNHX4, LsaNHX6 and LsaNHX8 genes and aquaporins PIP2 were up-regulated differentially by both AM fungi. The improved plant growth was closely related to a higher water status due to increased PIP2 abundance, as well as to the upregulation of LsaNHX gene expression, which concomitantly improved plant nutrition and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> homeostasis maintenance."

Genotype response was observed during deficit irrigation on fresh and dry mass at harvest. Vera revealed similar fresh mass at MAD levels 25% and 50%. Chicoric acid, caftaric acid, and chlorogenic and caffeic acid tended to increase at 50% MAD, while kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin increased at 75% MAD in both cultivars indicating increasing antioxidant properties. Ascorbic acid content declined with increasing MAD levels and no definite trend on β-carotene content was noted in these cultivars with respect to MAD irrigation. Deficit irrigation at 50% and 70% increased glucose concentration in cv. Lollo Bionda. Deficit irrigation influences the abiotic stress condition that stimulates the biosynthesis of phytochemicals in plants and improves crop quality. However, deficit irrigation can affect marketable crop yield. Based on findings of this study, the lettuce cv. Vera can be recommended as a suitable cultivar for deficit irrigation (at MAD 50% levels) for improving dietary phytochemicals and crop quality without compromising fresh mass for marketing."

Currently, the application of ECT for schizophrenia is controversial because of several international guidelines; however, catatonia is acceptable for the indications by all guidelines. Schizophrenic patients with affective, catatonic, and positive symptoms of recent onset may respond favorably to ECT. Additionally, ECT may improve responsivity to pharmacotherapy for some indications. Therefore, a combination of ECT with pharmacotherapy including clozapine may be effective for the pharmacotherapy -resistant schizophrenia. Another argument is that the relapse rate after ECT response is very high compared to that of mood disorders; development of maintenance therapy(pharmacotherapy or ECT) is anticipated for the prevention of relapse. Because maintenance ECT seems to be a burden on remitted patients, to study both maintenance pharmacotherapy and the novel application of non-invasive treatment, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), for maintenance therapy instead of ECT could be fruitful."

To our knowledge, there is to date no summary of studies or case reports in France, nor any proposal for guidelines concerning the management of medication of the patient to whom ECT sessions are offered. Indeed, several particularities must be considered. This article proposes to specify for each pharmacological class the possible interaction between ECT and medication. A first section of this article will be devoted to non-psychotropic treatments, and a second section to psychotropic treatments. A practical summary table is also provided. A review of the literature was conducted including all articles published prior to January 2019 referenced in Pub Med database, combining research with Medical Subject Headings \"Electroconvulsive Therapy\" and each following pharmacological class: \"Cardiovascular Agents\" \"Bronchodilator Agents\" \"Bronchoconstrictor Agents\" \"Theophylline\" \"Anticoagulants\" \"Hypoglycemic Agents\" \"Insulin\" \"Potassium\" \"Benzodiazepines\" \"Valproic Acid\" \"Carbamazepine\" \"Lamotrigine\" \"Lithium\" \"Antidepressive Agents\" \"Antipsychotic Agents\". After reading the titles, abstracts and whole articles, then searching for additional articles in the references, 50 articles were selected. A summary table summarizing the main risks and proposing a course of action has been produced. It is essential to take into account the specificity and the different physiological mechanisms involved in the ECT treatment in order to adjust the associated pharmacological treatments.

These new approaches include novel placements, optimization of electrical stimulus parameters, and new methods for inducing more targeted seizures(eg, magnetic seizure therapy [MST]). MST is the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation to induce a seizure. Magnetic fields pass through tissue unimpeded, providing more control over the site and extent of stimulation than can be achieved with ECT. This enhanced control represents a means of focusing the treatment on target cortical structures thought to be essential to antidepressant response and reducing spread to medial temporal regions implicated in the cognitive side effects of ECT. MST is at an early stage of development. Preliminary results suggest that MST may have some advantages over ECT in terms of subjective side effects and acute cognitive functioning. Studies designed to address the antidepressant efficacy of MST are underway. As with all attempts to improve convulsive therapy technique, the clinical value of MST will need to be established through controlled clinical trials. This article reviews the experience to date with MST, and places this work in the broader context of other means of optimizing convulsive therapy in the treatment of depression."

They were compared with a matched group of patients who received only pharmacotherapy. Although the ECT group had suffered more treatment resistant disorders, there was full clinical recovery in two months, when all were discharged. The group had significantly shortened duration of hospitalisation, after commencement of ECT. Hence ECT facilitated recovery in this potentially drug treatment resistant psychotic subjects. Although frequency of complaints of subjective memory difficulty increased during ECT and normalised at follow up, objective tests showed steady cognitive improvement with clinical recovery. Complaints of muscle pain (31.4%), post-ECT confusion (15.7%) and post-ECT headache (20%) in the first week of treatment, were not evident at follow up. Unmodified ECT combined with pharmacotherapy was safe and effective with non-enduring subjective memory difficulty for this potentially drug treatment resistant group of psychotic patients."

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most frequently occurring and invariably fatal primary brain tumor in adults. The vast majority of glioblastomas is characterized by chromosomal copy number alterations, including gain of whole chromosome 7 and loss of whole chromosome 10. Gain of whole chromosome 7 is an early event in gliomagenesis that occurs in proneural-like precursor cells, which give rise to all isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type glioblastoma transcriptional subtypes. <i>Platelet-derived growth factor A</i> (<i>PDGFA</i>) is one gene on chromosome 7 known to drive gliomagenesis, but, given its location near the end of 7p, there are likely several other genes located along chromosome 7 that select for its increased whole-chromosome copy number within glioblastoma cells. To identify other potential genes that could select for gain of whole chromosome 7, we developed an unbiased bioinformatics approach that identified <i>homeobox A5</i> (<i>HOXA5</i>) as a gene whose expression correlated with gain of chromosome 7 and a more aggressive phenotype of the resulting glioma. High expression of <i>HOXA5</i> in glioblastoma was associated with a proneural gene expression pattern and decreased overall survival in both human proneural and PDGF-driven mouse glioblastoma. Furthermore, <i>HOXA5</i> overexpression promoted cellular proliferation and potentiated radioresistance. We also found enrichment of <i>HOXA5</i> expression in recurrent human and mouse glioblastoma at first recurrence after radiotherapy. Overall, this study implicates <i>HOXA5</i> as a chromosome 7-associated gene-level locus that promotes selection for gain of whole chromosome 7 and an aggressive phenotype in glioblastoma."

          "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. Some of the genetic variations identified thus far, such as <i>IDH</i> mutation and <i>MGMT</i> promotor methylation, have implications for survival and response to therapy. A recent analysis of long-term GBM survivors showed that concurrent gain of chromosomes 19 and 20 (19/20 co-gain) is a positive prognostic factor that is independent of <i>IDH</i> mutation status. In this study, we retrospectively identified 18 patients with 19/20 co-gain and compared their imaging features to a control cohort without 19/20 co-gain. Imaging features such as tumor location, size, pial invasion, and ependymal extension were examined manually. When compared without further genetic subclassification, both groups showed similar imaging features except for rates of pial invasion. When each group was subclassified by <i>MGMT</i> promotor methylation status however, the two groups showed different imaging features in a number of additional ways including tumor location, size, and ependymal extension. Our results indicate that different permutations of various genetic mutations that coexist in GBM may interact in unpredictable ways to affect imaging appearance, and that imaging prognostication may be better approached in the context of the global genomic profile rather than individual genetic alterations."

A genetic analysis using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed that the tumor had a gain on the q arm of chromosome 1 (1q). Using CGH for a series of genetic analyses of more than 180 patients with gliomas, six were found to have a demonstrated 1q gain. Although the tumors in all six of these cases were histopathologically diagnosed as high-grade gliomas, compared with other malignant gliomas they demonstrated a good prognosis because of their favorable chemotherapeutic sensitivity. In immunohistochemical tests, most of the tumor cells in these cases were negative for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase, which antagonizes the effect of DNA-alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. The authors believed that a gain of 1q could be produced through the genetic events that cause loss of 1p, because these chromosomal aberrations have an imbalance of DNA copy number in common (1p < 1q). A gain of 1q is an infrequent chromosomal aberration and its clinical importance should be investigated in a larger study; however, patients with malignant gliomas demonstrating a 1q gain possibly show longer survival and good response to chemotherapy similar to patients with tumors demonstrating 1p loss. The importance of using genetic analysis for gliomas is emphasized in this report because it may help in selecting cases responsive to chemotherapy and because appropriate treatment for these patients will lead to progress in the treatment of malignant gliomas."

          "abstract": "Screening the whole glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) genome for aberrations is a good starting point when looking for molecular markers that could potentially stratify patients according to prognosis and optimal treatment. We investigated 80 primary untreated GBM using both G-banding analysis and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH). Abnormal karyotypes were found in 83% of the tumors. The most common numerical chromosome aberrations were +7, -10, -13, -14, -15, +20, and -22. Structural abnormalities most commonly involved chromosomes 1 and 3, and the short arm of chromosome 9. HR-CGH verified these findings and revealed additional frequent losses at 1p34-36, 6q22-27, and 19q12-13 and gains of 3q26 and 12q13-15. Although most karyotypes and gain/loss patterns were complex, there was also a distinct subset of tumors displaying simple karyotypic changes only. There was a statistically significant association between trisomy 7 and monosomy 10, and also between +7/-10 as putative primary aberrations and secondary losses of 1p, 9p, 13q, and 22q. The low number of tumors in the rarer histological tumor subgroups precludes definite conclusions, but there did not seem to be any clear-cut cytogenetic-pathological correlations, perhaps with the exception of ring chromosomes in giant cell glioblastomas. Our findings demonstrate that although GBM is a pathogenetically very heterogeneous group of diseases, distinct genomic aberration patterns exist."

Although this profile is potentially useful in distinguishing GBM from other tumor types, the techniques used tend to be labor intensive, and some can detect only gains or losses of genetic loci. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a powerful technique capable of identifying both gains and losses of DNA sequences. The present study compares the CGH evaluation of 22 GBM with classic cytogenetics, loss of heterozygosity by allelotyping, and gene amplification by Southern blot analysis to determine the reliability of CGH in the genetic characterization of GBM. The CGH and karyotypic data were consistent in showing gain of chromosome 7 accompanied by a loss of chromosome 10 as the most frequent abnormality, followed by a loss of 9p in 17 of 22 GBM cases. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 10 (19/22) and 9p (9/22) loci confirmed the underrepresentation by CGH. Genomic amplifications were observed by CGH in 5 of the 10 cases where gene amplification was detected by Southern blot analysis. The data show that CGH is equally reliable, compared with the more established genetic methods, for recognizing the prominent genetic alterations associated with GBM and support its use as a plausible adjunct to glioma classification."

It is characterized by its high intra- and intertumoral heterogeneity, in terms of both the level of single-nucleotide variants, copy number alterations, and aneuploidy. Therefore, routine diagnosis can be challenging in some cases. We present a complicated case of glioblastoma, which was characterized with five cytogenomic methods: interphase fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, comparative genomic hybridization array and single-nucleotide polymorphism, targeted gene panel, and whole-genome sequencing. These cytogenomic methods revealed classical findings associated with glioblastoma, such as a lack of <i>IDH</i> and <i>TERT</i> mutations, gain of chromosome 7, and loss of chromosome 10. At least three pathological clones were identified, including one with whole-genome duplication, and one with loss of 1p and suspected loss of 19q. Deletion and mutation of the <i>TP53</i> gene were detected with numerous breakends on 17p and 20q. Based on these findings, we recommend a combined approach to the diagnosis of glioblastoma involving the detection of copy number alterations, mutations, and aneuploidy. The choice of the best combination of methods is based on cost, time required, staff expertise, and laboratory equipment. This integrated strategy could contribute directly to tangible improvements in the diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of the therapeutic responses of patients with brain tumors."

We inferred the evolutionary trajectories of matched pairs of primary and relapsed tumors based on deep whole-genome-sequencing data. This analysis suggests both a distant origin of de novo glioblastoma, up to 7 years before diagnosis, and a common path of early tumorigenesis, with one or more of chromosome 7 gain, 9p loss, or 10 loss, at tumor initiation. TERT promoter mutations often occurred later as a prerequisite for rapid growth. In contrast to this common early path, relapsed tumors acquired no stereotypical pattern of mutations and typically regrew from oligoclonal origins, suggesting sparse selective pressure by therapeutic measures."

In some people, biliary tract cancer cells make extra copies of a gene called HER2 (also called ERBB2). This is known as being HER2-amplified. Zanidatamab is an antibody designed to destroy cancer cells that have higher-than-normal HER2 protein or gene levels. Zanidatamab is currently under research and is not yet approved for any diseases. Participants in this phase 2b clinical study had tumors that were HER2-amplified and at the advanced or metastatic stage. Participants also had cancer which had become worse after previous chemotherapy or had side effects that were too bad to continue chemotherapy. They also had to meet other requirements to be enrolled. Researchers measured the amount of HER2 protein in the tumor samples of the participants who were enrolled. There were 80 participants with tumors that were both HER2 amplified and had higher-than-normal HER2 protein amounts (considered to be 'HER2-positive'). There were 7 participants with tumors that were HER2-amplified, but had little-to-no levels of the HER2 protein (considered to be 'HER2-low'). All participants in the study were treated with zanidatamab and no other cancer treatments once every 2 weeks. In the HER2-positive group, 33 of 80 (41%) participants had their tumors shrink by 30% or more of their original size. In half of these participants, their tumors did not grow for 13 months or longer. No participant in the HER2-low group had their tumors shrink by 30% or more. In total, 63 of 87 participants (72%) had at least one side effect believed to be related to zanidatamab treatment. Most side effects were mild or moderate in severity. No participant died from complications related to zanidatamab. Diarrhea was one of the more common side effects and was experienced by 32 of 87 participants (37%). Side effects related to receiving zanidatamab through the vein, such as chills, fever, or high blood pressure, were experienced by 29 of 87 participants (33%). The results of this study support the potential for zanidatamab as a new therapy for people with HER2-positive biliary tract cancer after they had already received chemotherapy.

Two GluCl subunits have been localized in the pharynx in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the pharynx has been implicated as a major target for avermectins in C. elegans. However, in parasitic nematodes, the pharyngeal localization of the GluCl subunits needs to be determined. The HcGluCla gene encoding an alpha-type GluCl subunit has been cloned from Haemonchus contortus previously. To investigate the expression site of the HcGluCla gene we have isolated a 1439bp 5'-flanking region and determined the genomic organization of this gene. The HcGluCla gene is composed of 12 exons separated by 11 introns and spans approximately 7.3kb of genomic DNA. Analysis of the 1439bp 5'-flanking region of the HcGluCla gene revealed that it contained TATA, CCAAT boxes, and several other consensus transcriptional factor recognition sequences. The 1439bp 5'-flanking region and the first exon and intron and part of the second exon of the HcGluCla gene were fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene and microinjected into the gonads of C. elegans. After microinjection of the construct into C. elegans, four stable transformed lines were established and assayed for GFP expression. The transformed animals exhibited fluorescence in the two pairs of MC and M2 pharyngeal neurons, but no expression was detected in the muscle cells. Expression of HcGluCla in pharyngeal neurons suggests a mechanism for the effects of avermectins and milbemycins on pharyngeal function in parasitic nematodes."

We have shown previously that the divergent EBV DSL target promoter contains two zta-response regions, one within the minimal promoter and the other in an upstream lymphocyte-dependent enhancer region. In this study, we used footprinting and gel mobility retardation assays to reveal that bacterially synthesized Zta fusion proteins bound directly to six TGTGCAA-like motifs within DSL. Four of the Zta-binding sites lay adjacent to cellular TATA and CAAT factor-binding sites within the minimal promoter, and two mapped within the enhancer region. Single-copy oligonucleotides containing these Zta-binding sites conferred Zta responsiveness to heterologous promoters. In addition, the Zta protein, which possesses a similar basic domain to the conserved DNA-binding region of the c-Fos, c-Jun, GCN4, and CREB protein family, proved to bind directly to the consensus AP-1 site in the collagenase 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element. Cotransfection with zta also trans activated a target reporter gene containing inserted wild-type 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element oligonucleotides. Cellular AP-1 binding activity proved to be low in latently EBV-infected Raji cells but was induced (together with the Zta protein) after activation of the lytic cycle with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. We conclude that EBV may have captured and modified a cellular gene encoding a c-jun-like DNA-binding protein during its evolutionary divergence from other herpesviruses and that this protein is used to specifically redirect transcriptional activity toward expression of EBV lytic-cycle genes in infected cells."

However, drug trials targeting CB1 (encoded by the CNR1 gene) have been compromised by differences in patient response. Toward addressing the hypothesis that genetic changes within the regulatory regions controlling CNR1 expression contribute to these differences, we characterized the effects of disease-associated allelic variation within a conserved regulatory sequence (ECR1) in CNR1 intron 2 that had previously been shown to modulate cannabinoid response, alcohol intake, and anxiety-like behavior. We used primary cell analysis of reporters carrying different allelic variants of the human ECR1 and found that human-specific C-allele variants of ECR1 (ECR1(C)) drove higher levels of CNR1prom activity in primary hippocampal cells than did the ancestral T-allele and demonstrated a differential response to CB1 agonism. We further demonstrate a role for the AP-1 transcription factor in driving higher ECR1(C) activity and evidence that the ancestral t-allele variant of ECR1 interacted with higher affinity with the insulator binding factor CTCF.

Following screening with 4(th) generation combination immunoassay, confirmation of HIV infection is performed with an antibody assay that differentiates HIV-1 from HIV-2 infection. In the newly updated algorithm, samples that are nonreactive or indeterminate in the differentiation assay are to be tested with an HIV-1 nucleic acid amplification (NAAT) test for resolution.

To assess the performance of Xpert HIV-1 Qual supplementary assay in resolving the clinical status of serum samples reactive by 4(th) generation immunoassays and indeterminate or negative by Geenius HIV-1/2 confirmatory assay. In a retrospective study, samples from 97 individuals for whom the true HIV-1 status was already known (by follow-up samples) and which were negative or indeterminate by HIV-1/2 Geenius assay were tested with Xpert Qual HIV-1 assay. Xpert Qual assay correctly classified all 97 samples from HIV-1 positive (n=49) and negative (n=48) individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert Qual when using the true HIV status as a reference were 100% (92.7-100% at 95% confidence interval [CI] and 92.6-100% at 95% CI, respectively). Applying Xpert Qual HIV-1 assay in the new HIV multi-stage diagnostic algorithm correctly classified 100% of HIV-1 infections including 49 from HIV-1 carriers who have not yet seroconverted. With this assay the total time required for acute HIV diagnosis could be significantly reduced."

We have used a serum HIV antigen (HIV-Ag) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to diagnose acute HIV infection in four high-risk patients. The clinical syndrome in these four patients was characterized by fever (four), rash (three), myalgias-arthralgias (three), and pharyngitis (two). All patients had spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within eight to 12 days. Serum HIV antibody, as measured by a commercially available screening EIA and by Western blot analysis, was negative in all patients at time of presentation and all seroconverted on subsequent testing. Human immunodeficiency virus was isolated from two of two patients during the acute illness. Initial serum samples from all four patients were positive for HIV-Ag. Serum samples of three of four patients became negative for HIV-Ag and positive for HIV antibody. These data suggest that serum HIV-Ag detection by EIA may be useful in the diagnosis of the acute syndrome caused by HIV infection."

Laboratory tests for HIV infection are mainly serological antibody and antigen testing and HIV RNA testing. With the update of testing reagents, the sensitivity and specificity have improved substantially and the window period of detection has shortened, but there is a risk of false positives. Various guidelines have recommended different diagnostic strategies for different target populations and different prevalence regions to guide patients to confirm the diagnosis and receive standardized antiretroviral therapy as early as possible. How to refer to the diagnostic strategies, reduce false positives and shorten the window period while increasing the detection rate is an urgent issue for laboratories to address. This article describes the characteristics and advantages and disadvantages of testing methods related to HIV infection from the perspective of laboratory diagnostic strategies, as well as the impact of the development of treatments on diagnostic strategies, in order to provide theoretical support for the practical application of HIV diagnostic strategies."

Four of these tests can be done in point-of-care and nonclinical settings because they use whole blood or oral fluid and are simple to perform. An assay for detection of HIV-1 RNA has been approved by the FDA to detect HIV infection before seroconversion has occurred and to confirm results of reactive screening tests; pooled testing of specimens for HIV-1 RNA has increased the cost-effectiveness of this screening tool.

When this happens, resistance tests are needed to guide treatment changes. Resistance is also used to assess the transmission of drug resistance to newly diagnosed patients. Finally, before using an anti-CCR5 drug, viral tropism needs to be determined.

The SNP or mutation can be relevant to disease susceptibility, pathogenesis of disease, and efficacy of specific drugs. It is important to detect SNPs or mutations clinically. Methods to distinguish/detect SNPs or mutations should be highly specific and sensitive. In this regard, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided the necessary analytical performance for many molecular analyses. PCR-based methods for SNP/mutation detection are broadly categorized into two types-(1) polymorphic or mutant allele-directed specific analysis using primers matched with substituted nucleotide or using oligonucleotides to block or clamp the nontargeted template, and (2) melting curve analysis, which is combined with the real-time PCR techniques using hydrolysis probes, hybridization probes, or double-stranded DNA-binding fluorescent dyes. Innovative and novel approaches as well as technical improvements have made SNP- or mutation-detection methods increasingly more sophisticated.

However, with more systematic SNP development, one might expect an increasing proportion of SNPs to be distributed more or less randomly. Here, I test this null hypothesis using stochastic simulations and compare this output with that of an alternative hypothesis that mutations are more likely to occur near existing SNPs, a possibility suggested both by molecular studies of meiotic mismatch repair in yeast and by data showing that SNPs cluster around heterozygous deletions. A purely Poisson process generates SNP clusters that differ from equivalent data from human chromosome 1 in both the frequency of different-sized clusters and the SNP density within each cluster, even for small clusters of just four or five SNPs, while clusters on the X chromosome differ from those on the autosomes. In contrast, modest levels of mutational non-independence generate a reasonable fit to the real data for both cluster frequency and density, and also exhibit the evolutionary transience noted for 'mutation hotspots'. Mutational non-independence therefore provides an interesting new hypothesis that appears capable of explaining the distribution of SNPs in the human genome."

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is the most common mutation in the human genome and a large number of SNPs have been identified to date. It is unlikely to examine the functional impact of all these mutations using an experimental approach. As such, we employed two algorithms, Sorting Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) to predict the impact of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) on NR activities and disease susceptibility. We identified 442 nsSNPs in a systematic screening of 48 human NR genes. Using SIFT, of 442 amino acid substitutions, 289 (65.38%) were classified as \"intolerant\". The PolyPhen program classified 269 (60.86%) of them as \"probably damaging\" or \"possibly damaging\". The results from the two algorithms were in concordance. Among the 442 mutations, 229 of them have been functionally characterized. SIFT predicted 192 of these nsSNPs as \"intolerant\", resulting in a correct prediction rate of 83.84%, while PolyPhen gave a prediction rate of 76.86%. For 216 nsSNPs of the androgen receptor gene, 149 nsSNPs have been functionally studied and most (121) of them resulted in a reduction of receptor activity. SIFT sorted 187 out of 216 as \"intolerant\" (86.57%) and PolyPhen identified 159 out of 216 as \"potentially intolerant\" (73.61%). These results indicate that both SIFT and PolyPhen are useful and efficient tools to predict the functional effects of nsSNPs of human NR genes."

          "abstract": "Despite the fundamental importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to human evolution, there are still large gaps in our understanding of the forces that shape their distribution across the genome. SNPs have been shown to not be distributed evenly, with directly adjacent SNPs found unusually frequently. Why this is the case is unclear. We illustrate how neighboring SNPs that cannot be explained by a single mutation event (that we term here sequential dinucleotide mutations [SDMs]) are driven by distinct processes to SNPs and multinucleotide polymorphisms (MNPs). By studying variation across populations, including a novel cohort of 1,358 Scottish genomes, we show that, SDMs are over twice as common as MNPs and like SNPs display distinct mutational spectra across populations. These biases are not only different to those observed among SNPs and MNPs but are also more divergent between human population groups. We show that the changes that make up SDMs are not independent and identify a distinct mutational profile, CA → CG → TG, that is observed an order of magnitude more often than expected from background SNP rates and the numbers of other SDMs involving the gain and deamination of CpG sites. Intriguingly particular pathways through the amino acid code appear to have been favored relative to that expected from intergenic SDM rates and the occurrences of coding SNPs, and in particular those that lead to the creation of single codon amino acids. We finally present evidence that epistatic selection has potentially disfavored sequential nonsynonymous changes in the human genome."

It is plausible that breast milk, which consists of melatonin, may have an effect on improving infants' sleep and reducing infantile colic. Our first goal was to assess the differences in the prevalence and severity of infantile colic and nocturnal sleep between breast-fed infants and supplement-fed infants. The second was to characterize the profile of melatonin secretion in human breast milk compared to artificial formulas. Ninety-four mothers of healthy 2 to 4-month-old infants filled a questionnaire regarding irritability/potential infantile colic and sleep characteristics. For the second part, we measured melatonin levels in breast milk of five women every 2 h during 24 h and in three samples of commonly used artificial formulas. Exclusively breast-fed infants had a significantly lower incidence of colic attacks (p = 0.04), lower severity of irritability attacks (p = 0.03), and a trend for longer nocturnal sleep duration (p = 0.06). Melatonin in human milk showed a clear circadian curve and was unmeasurable in all artificial milks. Exclusive breastfeeding is associated with reduced irritability/colic and a tendency toward longer nocturnal sleep. Breast milk (nocturnal) consists of substantial melatonin levels, whereas artificial formulas do not. We speculate that melatonin which is supplied to the infant via breast milk plays a role in improving sleep and reducing colic in breast-fed infants compared to formula-fed ones."

          "abstract": "Melatonin, an endogenous indolamine derived from tryptophan, is primarily synthesized by the pineal gland in mammals and regulated by a complex neural system. Its release follows a circadian rhythm, which is crucial for regulating physiological processes in response to light-dark cycles in both humans and animals. In this review, we report that the presence of this hormone in bovine milk, with significant differences in concentration between daytime and nighttime milking, has increased interest in milk as a natural source of bioactive molecules. Melatonin lowers cortisol levels at night, reduces body temperature and blood pressure, coinciding with decreased alertness and performance, acts as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, modulates the immune system, offers neuroprotective benefits, and supports gastrointestinal health by scavenging free radicals and reducing oxidative stress in dairy cows. Many factors influence the release of melatonin, such as the intensity of artificial lighting during nighttime milking, the frequency of milkings, milk yield, and genetic differences between animals. Nocturnal milking under low-intensity light boosts melatonin, potentially reducing oxidative damage and mastitis risk. Additionally, ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment does not significantly affect the melatonin content in milk. However, further research on its stability during milk processing and storage is crucial for ensuring product efficacy. In some countries, nighttime milk with naturally elevated melatonin content is already commercialized as a natural aid for sleep. Thus, naturally melatonin-rich milk may be a promising alternative to synthetic supplements for promoting better sleep and overall well-being."

Breast milk contains melatonin, which exhibits a 24-hour pattern. Melatonin promotes sleep onset and is barely detected in daytime milk but rises in the evening and peaks early in the morning. Melatonin supports the development of an infant's own circadian rhythm and is important for neurodevelopment. Currently, donor banks pasteurize breast milk using a Holder Pasteurization (HoP) technique where breast milk is treated at a high temperature (+62°) for 30 minutes before cooling to eliminate any pathogens before it is given to infants. It is not known how the pasteurization process affects the melatonin levels in breast milk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the pasteurization process reduces melatonin levels in breast milk. <b><i>Materials and Methods:</i></b> Ten night-time breast milk samples were collected and each divided into two groups; one group remained unpasteurized and the other group was pasteurized using the HoP technique. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Melatonin levels between the unpasteurized and pasteurized groups were compared.

          "abstract": "The level of melatonin in human milk might be closely related to infant development and the building up of their circadian rhythms. The large population investigation on this topic would provide insights for the prevention and treatment of diseases related to early development and circadian rhythms. However, it has not been well studied. Trace level endogenous melatonin and difficulties in sample collection are among the challenges limiting the progress. High throughput analytical method with high specificity and sensitivity to determine the endogenous melatonin concentration is highly desired. A newly developed easily operated and high-throughput sensitive on-line enrichment liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method would be reported in this paper. Melatonin-d<sub>3</sub> (MEL-d<sub>3</sub>) was used as a surrogate standard for the calibration curve and melatonin-d<sub>4</sub> (MEL-d<sub>4</sub>) was used as an internal standard. Sample preparation was simply performed in 96-well plate by protein precipitation using acetonitrile (ACN). The supernatant was injected directly into the easily configured LC-MS/MS system with an enlarged sample loop and a mixer. Positive mode multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was adopted for the measurement of melatonin in milk. 100 μL sample was used for analysis and the calibration curve linear range was 1-1000 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>. In three validation batches, the accuracy was within 11.0% deviation from the relative nominal concentration, whereas the intra- and inter-assay precision was ≤4.1% and ≤6.8% relative standard deviation (RSD), respectively. Although matrix effect was observed in the validation experiments, the stable isotope labeled internal standard (MEL-d<sub>4</sub>) could correct it and the overall relative matrix effect of MEL-d<sub>3</sub>/MEL-d<sub>4</sub> was close to 100%. The overall spike recovery of the method was 101.7% with 5.1% RSD. Compared to currently reported methods, it could reach 1 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) with a smaller sample volume, sample preparation could be easily performed by automated liquid handling system and was more suitable for large population cohort studies on trace level endogenous melatonin determination."

          "abstract": "<b><i>Objective:</i></b> Cesarean section rates are increasing in developed countries and could be performed as an emergency or elective procedure. Our research aim was to determine whether elective cesarean section influences the melatonin content, the main circadian hormone, in human milk. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Twenty-one women after vaginal delivery and 18 women after elective cesarean section were included. Only healthy mothers with normal newborns exclusively breastfed were recruited. Two samples of human milk were collected for each woman at three stages of lactation: colostrum, transitional milk, and mature milk; at each stage, one daytime sample and another nighttime sample were obtained. In total, 228 milk samples were studied. The melatonin content was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Melatonin rhythmicity with higher melatonin content at night was maintained at each of the three stages of lactation, regardless of the type of delivery. A higher melatonin content was found in daytime colostrum after cesarean section with respect to colostrum obtained from mothers after vaginal delivery (30.3 pg/mL versus 14.7 pg/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.020). Melatonin content decreased progressively throughout the course of lactation in both groups. This decrease was significant when comparing transitional milk to colostrum in the cesarean group, both in the daytime (<i>p</i> = 0.016) and nighttime samples (<i>p</i> = 0.048). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Cesarean section is associated with an increase in daytime colostrum melatonin. No difference was observed in mature milk with respect to vaginal delivery. Melatonin values in human milk decrease during the first month of lactation and circadian rhythmicity was observed irrespective of the mode of delivery."

[3H]Melatonin was found to be rapidly transferred from the maternal circulation into lactating mammary tissue, and the stomach of each suckling rat was found to contain [3H]melatonin. To study the fate and tissue distribution of [3H]melatonin originating in the neonatal stomach, suckling rats were given [3H]melatonin by stomach tube; [3H]melatonin was recovered from plasma and seven tissues, including brain, 15 and 60 min later. The general tissue distribution of [3H]melatonin was similar to that found in adult rats. The major [3H]melatonin metabolites in the urine of suckling rats, as the adult rats, were the conjugates of 6-hydroxy-melatonin."

          "abstract": "Breastfeeding is the most appropriate source of a newborn's nutrition; among the plethora of its benefits, its modulation of circadian rhythmicity with melatonin as a potential neuroendocrine transducer has gained increasing interest. Transplacental transfer assures melatonin provision for the fetus, who is devoid of melatonin secretion. Even after birth, the neonatal pineal gland is not able to produce melatonin rhythmically for several months (with an even more prolonged deficiency following preterm birth). In this context, human breast milk constitutes the main natural source of melatonin: diurnal dynamic changes, an acrophase early after midnight, and changes in melatonin concentrations according to gestational age and during the different stages of lactation have been reported. Understudied thus far are the factors impacting on (changes in) melatonin content in human breast milk and their clinical significance in chronobiological adherence in the neonate: maternal as well as environmental aspects have to be investigated in more detail to guide nursing mothers in optimal feeding schedules which probably means a synchronized instead of mistimed feeding practice. This review aims to be thought-provoking regarding the critical role of melatonin in chrononutrition during breastfeeding, highlighting its potential in circadian entrainment and therefore optimizing (neuro)developmental outcomes in the neonatal setting."

The action of these androgens can be associated with the level of hormones in circulation and with the genetic predisposition which will influence the activity of these androgens at the periphery. The classifications of the evolution of alopecia will be done following Norwood for the male and following Ludwig for the female. Hormonal investigation will be effectuated on the female only in the case of research on or the identification of hyperandrogenia; this is essential in order to direct the therapy. The diagnose and the therapeutic follow-up are essentially clinical but can be assisted by a trichogram which will show-up the miniaturisation process of androgenetic alopecia and the telogen effluvium of the affected areas. The treatment of alopecia can be local or general. The local treatment will use a lotion of minoxidil 2 to 5% whether the patient is male of female. On males, an inhibitor of the 5 alpha reductase 2, finasteride, has shown its efficiency at a dose of 1 mg/day. On females oestroprogestatives will be used, if they are not counter-advised, associated with an anti-androgen: either cyproterone acetate or spironolactone. A therapeutic evaluation will be made after 6 months of treatment."

Its physiopathology comprises a genetic predisposition affording an exacerbated response of the hair follicles cells to androgens aggravated by scalp inflammation and extrinsic factors. This paper presents a review of the mechanisms and extrinsic factors involved in the AGA physiopathology as well as its conventional and emerging treatments. The research focused on reports regarding AGA physiopathology and treatments published between January 2001 and July 2019 in medical and related journals. The most used medical treatments for AGA-minoxidil and finasteride-present non satisfactory results in some cases. Currently, the low-level laser therapy is recognized as a safe and effective treatment for AGA. Some minimally invasive techniques-mesotherapy, microneedling, carboxytherapy, and platelet-rich plasma-are also used to stimulate hair growth. Pharmaceutical substances with mechanisms differing from the anti-androgen activity are under current investigation and many of them have botanical origins; however, formulations with higher performance are required, and the hair follicles ability of being a drug and nanoparticle reservoir has been researched. The association of different strategies, that is, substances with synergic mechanisms and the use of advantageous technologies associated with lifestyle changes could improve the treatment outcomes."

When maintaining a dapsone dosage at 25 mg/day no relapse occurred during 3 years and 1 year, respectively. No important adverse effect to dapsone was evidenced. After dapsone withdrawal, a moderate relapse of the disease with pruritus and folliculitis occurred after a few weeks in both cases.

Transverse and vertical sections of biopsy specimens showed dense, dermal sclerosis with marked eccrine gland atrophy and replacement of much of the adipose by collagenous tissue. All sebaceous glands had disappeared, but erector pili muscles persisted. Numerous vertical, columnar and epithelial structures were present at the sites of formerly viable hair follicles. Transverse sections of these atrophic follicular remnants had a resemblance to telogen follicles but were microscopically different.

Here, we review mutational, transcriptional, and epigenomic alterations that contribute to tumour heterogeneity in melanoma, and their potential to drive melanoma invasion and metastasis. We also discuss three models that are hypothesized to contribute towards aspects of tumour heterogeneity and tumour progression in melanoma, namely the clonal evolution model, the cancer stem cell model, and the phenotype switching model.

Melanoma has been shown to dynamically shift between different transcriptional states or phenotypes. This is referred to as phenotype switching in melanoma, and it involves switching between quiescent and proliferative cell cycle states, and dramatic shifts in invasiveness, as well as changes in signaling pathways in the melanoma cells, and immune cell composition in the TME. Melanoma cell plasticity is associated with altered gene expression in immune cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts, as well as changes in extracellular matrix, which drive the metastatic cascade and therapeutic resistance. Therefore, resistance to therapy in melanoma is not only dependent on genetic evolution, but it has also been suggested to be driven by gene expression changes and adaptive phenotypic cell plasticity. This review discusses recent findings in melanoma phenotype switching, immunotherapy resistance, and the balancing of the homeostatic TME between the different melanoma cell subpopulations. We also discuss future perspectives of the biology of neural crest-like state(s) in melanoma."

          "abstract": "An emerging concept in melanoma biology is that of dynamic, adaptive phenotype switching, where cells switch from a highly proliferative, poorly invasive phenotype to a highly invasive, less proliferative one. This switch may hold significant implications not just for metastasis, but also for therapy resistance. We demonstrate that phenotype switching and subsequent resistance can be guided by changes in expression of receptors involved in the noncanonical Wnt5A signaling pathway, ROR1 and ROR2. ROR1 and ROR2 are inversely expressed in melanomas and negatively regulate each other. Furthermore, hypoxia initiates a shift of ROR1-positive melanomas to a more invasive, ROR2-positive phenotype. Notably, this receptor switch induces a 10-fold decrease in sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors. In patients with melanoma treated with the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib, Wnt5A expression correlates with clinical response and therapy resistance. These data highlight the fact that mechanisms that guide metastatic progression may be linked to those that mediate therapy resistance. These data show for the fi rst time that a single signaling pathway, the Wnt signaling pathway, can effectively guide the phenotypic plasticity of tumor cells, when primed to do so by a hypoxic microenvironment. Importantly, this increased Wnt5A signaling can give rise to a subpopulation of highly invasive cells that are intrinsically less sensitive to novel therapies for melanoma, and targeting the Wnt5A/ROR2 axis could improve the efficacy and duration of response for patients with melanoma on vemurafenib."

          "abstract": "Melanoma arises from neural crest-derived melanocytes which reside mostly in the skin in an adult organism. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a tumorigenic programme through which cells acquire mesenchymal, more pro-oncogenic phenotype. The reversible phenotype switching is an event still not completely understood in melanoma. The EMT features and increased invasiveness are associated with lower levels of the pivotal lineage identity maintaining and melanoma-specific transcription factor MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor), whereas increased proliferation is linked to higher MITF levels. However, the precise role of MITF in phenotype switching is still loosely characterized. To exclude the changes occurring upstream of MITF during MITF regulation in vivo, we employed a model whereby MITF expression was inducibly regulated by shRNA in melanoma cell lines. We found that the decrease in MITF caused only moderate attenuation of proliferation of the whole cell line population. Proliferation was decreased in five of 15 isolated clones, in three of them profoundly. Reduction in MITF levels alone did not generally produce EMT-like characteristics. The stem cell marker levels also did not change appreciably, only a sharp increase in SOX2 accompanied MITF down-regulation. Oppositely, the downstream differentiation markers and the MITF transcriptional targets melastatin and tyrosinase were profoundly decreased, as well as the downstream target livin. Surprisingly, after the MITF decline, invasiveness was not appreciably affected, independently of proliferation. The results suggest that low levels of MITF may still maintain relatively high proliferation and might reflect, rather than cause, the EMT-like changes occurring in melanoma."

          "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma represents the most fatal skin cancer due to its high metastatic capacity. According to the \"phenotype switching\" model, the aggressive nature of melanoma cells results from their intrinsic potential to dynamically switch from a high-proliferative/low-invasive to a low-proliferative/high-invasive state. Here we identify the low affinity neurotrophin receptor CD271 as a key effector of phenotype switching in melanoma. CD271 plays a dual role in this process by decreasing proliferation, while simultaneously promoting invasiveness. Dynamic modification of CD271 expression allows tumor cells to grow at low levels of CD271, to reduce growth and invade when CD271 expression is high, and to re-expand at a distant site upon decrease of CD271 expression. Mechanistically, the cleaved intracellular domain of CD271 controls proliferation, while the interaction of CD271 with the neurotrophin receptor Trk-A modulates cell adhesiveness through dynamic regulation of a set of cholesterol synthesis genes relevant for patient survival."

Moreover, the neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity is the cornerstone of multiple immunotherapies. In fact, several strategies targeting neoantigen have been attempted for synergetic effect with immune checkpoint inhibitor. Increasing neoantigen presentation to immune system by oncolytic virus, radiotherapy, or cancer vaccine is feasible to enhance neoantigen-specific T cell reactivity in theory. However, some obstacles have not been overcome in practice such as dynamic variation of neoantigen landscape, identification of potential neoantigen, maintenance of high T cell titer post vaccination.

          "abstract": "The prognostic potential of immune-related genes, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), is gaining attention for evaluating the prognosis of breast cancer patients. We analyzed 23 datasets to identify 15 ICI-related mRNAs and 5 immune-related lncRNAs, creating a robust immune score (IS). This score was used to classify patients into high and low IS groups and assess their survival outcomes. Patients with high IS showed significantly poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those with low IS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed IS as an independent prognostic factor. Additionally, high IS was associated with higher mutation loads and neoantigen profiles, while low IS correlated with enhanced immune cell infiltration. The immune score developed from ICI-related mRNAs and lncRNAs effectively predicts the prognosis of breast cancer patients and highlights the differential immune and inflammatory responses between patients with varying levels of immune score. This underscores the relevance of IS in guiding therapeutic decisions and tailoring patient management strategies in clinical settings."

This article comments on the role of epigenetics in the pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and nutritional management of these disorders. There are two classes of epigenetic drugs undergoing trials for treating the idiopathic mental disorders: DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors. These drugs may fulfil the need for newer and more effective drugs for treating these disorders. Psychotherapy could exert its therapeutic effect in idiopathic mental disorders through epigenetic mechanisms. As nutrients like folic acid and vitamin B(12) can influence an individual's epigenome, especially early in life, abnormal intakes of such agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of the idiopathic mental disorders. Hence, adequate emphasis should be given to such factors in an individual's nutrition, especially early in life. Nutrients such as L-methylfolate and S-adenosylmethionine may also be useful in nutritional therapy of these disorders. Epigenetics plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the idiopathic mental disorders. Due emphasis should be given to epigenetic mechanisms in the pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and nutritional management of these disorders."

Mutations in the gene for EGFR can cause cancer, including some cases of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Afatinib is a medicine that blocks mutated <i>EGFR</i> and helps kill cancer cells. Many different types of <i>EGFR</i> mutation have been identified in people with NSCLC. Over three quarters of cases are caused by two types of <i>EGFR</i> mutation, known as common <i>EGFR</i> mutations, but some cases are caused by unusual/uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations. People with NSCLC who have these unusual/ uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations are often excluded from clinical trials. Consequently, researchers don't really know how well medicines like afatinib work in these people. This is a summary of a study reporting findings from a large database of people with non-small-cell lung cancer (also called NSCLC) who have unusual or uncommon changes in a gene called <i>EGFR</i> and who received afatinib. The researchers used the database to see how effective afatinib is in people who have different types of unusual <i>EGFR</i> mutation. Afatinib seems to work well in people with NSCLC who have not already been treated. Part of the study also looked at people who had received a similar treatment, called osimertinib, in the past compared to those who had not been treated with this medicine. The researchers found that afatinib works well in most people with NSCLC who have unusual/uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations, although it seems to work better against certain types of these mutations than others. The researchers concluded that afatinib is a treatment option for most people with NSCLC and unusual/uncommon <i>EGFR</i> mutations. It is important for doctors to identify the precise type of <i>EGFR</i> mutation in a tumor before starting treatment."

Hyaluronic acid injections can reduce osteoarthritic pain but require three to five doses administered weekly. This preliminary study aims to assess the efficacy of a more flexible viscosupplementation regimen. Patients were given three sodium hyaluronate isotonic solution injections (Ostenil; TRB Chemedica SA, Vouvry, Switzerland), biweekly. They were then asked to record their pain before and after administration of the injections, on a visual analog score. A total of 91 knees were injected. Analysis of the data showed that the viscosupplementation injections significantly reduced the baseline pain within the first 24 to 48 hours post first injection (before injection, 68.8mm; 2 days postinjection, 48.9 mm; p < 0.001); these effects were maintained up to 6 months. No adverse effects were reported. The proposed regimen appears safe and efficient in reducing osteoarthritic pain of the knee joint. A randomized controlled study is needed to confirm these results."

We examined the mid-term (2-year) efficacy of IA-HA in Japanese subjects by using a large-scale population-based cohort of the Research on Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis Against Disability study. We performed a nested case control study of 60 case control pairs matched for age (within 1 year), sex, Kellgren and Lawrence grade, and history of knee pain. The mean follow-up period after IA-HA series was 2.9 years in case patients. We examined the association of IA-HA with knee radiographic severity and knee pain. To estimate radiographic severity of OA, six distinct features--joint space area and the minimum joint space width at medial and lateral sides, osteophyte area, and tibiofemoral angle--were measured using a fully automatic computer-assisted program. Comparison of the radiographic parameters between case patients and controls showed that the medial and lateral joint space areas were significantly bigger in case patients than in controls. After constructing a multivariate logistic regression model to examine the correlation of knee pain, IA-HA, and radiographic features, we found that unlike radiographic features, IA-HA was protectively associated with the presence of pain. IA-HA might effectively improve joint structure and relieve pain in patients with knee OA."

A total of 85 patients with KBD-based knee pain were treated with two cycles of a 5-week course of sodium hyaluronate and received clinical assessments with a follow-up period of 24 months after the first cycle. The primary efficacy measure was the visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score. The second efficacy measure included the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores; and the patients' and physicians' global assessments. Tolerability was evaluated based on adverse events (AEs). Seventy-one patients (83.5%) completed the final study. The VAS was significantly reduced from 65.06 ± 12.21 mm (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) at baseline to 30.17 ± 11.92 mm at 6 months and was maintained for 24 months (35.79 ± 7.92 mm, P < 0.01 vs baseline).

The overall incidence of AEs during the first and second cycles was 8 (9.4%) and 7 patients (8.2%), respectively. No serious AEs were reported. Repeated once yearly cycles of intra-articular sodium hyaluronate injections may improve knee KBD symptoms during the inbetween cycle period as well as exert a significant carry-over effect for at least 1 year after the repeated cycle.

Depression was significantly associated with IKDC, WOMAC physical function subscale, and total WOMAC scores. Anxiety was only significantly associated with the WOMAC pain subscale score. Pain severity was significantly associated with IKDC, WOMAC stiffness subscale, WOMAC physical function subscale, and total WOMAC scores.

In a prospective study, 20 patients (21 knees) with haemophilic arthropathy of the knee received 20 mg hyaluronic acid by intra-articular injection for 5 consecutive weeks. Assessment included clinical scores, X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biomechanical motion analysis before and 3 months after the first injection. The score of the WFH advisory committee and the Aichroth score for special evaluation of the knee were used. After an average period of 26 months, the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) score, the Aichroth score and the visual analogue scale were evaluated again. All patients had pain caused by their arthropathy, nine of them had positive antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus, and 15 had chronic hepatitis C. The mean WFH score was 8.1 points, the Petterson score was 7.3 points and the Aichroth score was 38 points (maximum 55 points). The WFH score decreased to 7.3 points, the Aichroth score improved to 40 points and the subjective assessment measured with a visual analogue scale improved from 5.3 to 3.7 points. No differences from MRI controls were detected. After 3 months, 14 of 20 patients improved subjectively, particularly in longer walking distance, stair-climbing or initial pain. These positive aspects were limited by arthropathy in adjacent joints. After 26 months 10 patients still are benefiting for up to 31 months follow-up.

Intra-articular injections of the viscosupplement for each group were administered to the patients three times at one-week intervals. The primary outcome was differences in changes of weight-bearing pain scores at 16 weeks between the groups. The secondary outcomes were changes in the intensity of knee pain during weight-bearing, walking, and rest, and functional disability, quality of life, and adverse events during the 16-week follow-up period. At 16 weeks, the polynucleotide group showed a higher reduction in pain score using a Visual Analog Scale score (0-100) than the classic hyaluronic acid (-17.6 [95% CI = -35.1 to -0.1]; P = .048) and crosslinked hyaluronic acid (-22.4 [95% CI = -41.5 to -3.3]; P = .016) groups. The polynucleotide and crosslinked hyaluronic acid groups showed an early-onset reduction in knee pain during weight-bearing, walking, and rest. All three groups showed reductions in functional disability and improved quality of life at 16 weeks without inter-group differences. No severe adverse events were reported throughout the study period. Polynucleotide significantly relieves pain more and relieves pain faster in patients with knee osteoarthritis than classic and crosslinked hyaluronic acid, with improved health-related quality of life."

However, redundancy exists in these states as different combinations of TFs can induce broadly similar cell types. We previously demonstrated that by overcoming gene silencing, it is possible to deterministically reprogram human pluripotent stem cells directly into cell types of various lineages. In the present study we leverage the consistency and precision of our approach to explore four different TF combinations encoding astrocyte identity, based on previously published reports. Analysis of the resulting induced astrocytes (iAs) demonstrated that all four cassettes generate cells with the typical morphology of in vitro astrocytes, which expressed astrocyte-specific markers. The transcriptional profiles of all four iAs clustered tightly together and displayed similarities with mature human astrocytes, although maturity levels differed between cells. Importantly, we found that the TF cassettes induced iAs with distinct differences with regards to their cytokine response and calcium signaling. In vivo transplantation of selected iAs into immunocompromised rat brains demonstrated long term stability and integration. In conclusion, all four TF combinations were able to induce stable astrocyte-like cells that were morphologically similar but showed subtle differences with respect to their transcriptome. These subtle differences translated into distinct differences with regards to cell function, that could be related to maturation state and/or regional identity of the resulting cells. This insight opens an opportunity to precision-engineer cells to meet functional requirements, for example, in the context of therapeutic cell transplantation."

This gene encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an intermediate filament protein expressed primarily in astrocytes.

The most active of these was the 124-bp B region, which spans bp -1612 to -1489. We have now used site-directed mutagenesis to analyze this region in greater detail, and show that the B region itself contains several important elements. The most crucial of these is a consensus AP-1 sequence, the binding site for the Fos and Jun families of transcription factors. The presence of members of both these families in the glial fibrillary acidic protein-expressing U251 cell line used for our transfection studies was verified by gel mobility-shift experiments. This is the first demonstration of the functioning of a specific transcription factor site for astrocytes, and provides a focus for future studies of glial fibrillary acidic protein regulation during development and reactive gliosis."

We have investigated whether positional identity, a fundamental organizing principle governing the generation of neuronal subtype diversity, is also relevant to astrocyte diversification. We identified three positionally distinct subtypes of white-matter astrocytes (WMA) in the spinal cord, which can be distinguished by the combinatorial expression of Reelin and Slit1. These astrocyte subtypes derive from progenitor domains expressing the homeodomain transcription factors Pax6 and Nkx6.1, respectively. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicate that the positional identity of these astrocyte subtypes is controlled by Pax6 and Nkx6.1 in a combinatorial manner. Thus, positional identity is an organizing principle underlying astrocyte, as well as neuronal, subtype diversification and is controlled by a homeodomain transcriptional code whose elements are reutilized following the specification of neuronal identity earlier in development."

          "abstract": "Astrocytes are the most abundant and functionally diverse glial population in the vertebrate central nervous system (CNS). However, the mechanisms underlying astrocyte specification are poorly understood. It is well established that cellular diversification of neurons in the embryo is generated by position-dependent extrinsic signals and combinatorial interactions of transcription factors that direct specific cell fates by suppressing alternative fates. It is unknown whether a comparable process determines embryonic astrocyte identity. Indeed, astrocyte development is generally thought to take place in a position-independent manner. Here we show multiple functions of Stem cell leukaemia (Scl, also known as Tal1), which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, in the regulation of both astrocyte versus oligodendrocyte cell fate acquisition and V2b versus V2a interneuron cell fate acquisition in the p2 domain of the developing vertebrate spinal cord. Our findings demonstrate a regionally restricted transcriptional programme necessary for astrocyte and V2b interneuron development, with striking parallels to the involvement of SCL in haematopoiesis. They further indicate that acquisition of embryonic glial subtype identity might be regulated by genetic interactions between SCL and the transcription factor Olig2 in the ventral neural tube."

          "abstract": "Astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the central nervous system (CNS) and have a multitude of functions that include maintenance of CNS homeostasis, trophic support of neurons, detoxification, and immune surveillance. It has only recently been appreciated that astrocyte dysfunction is a primary cause of many neurological disorders. Despite their importance in disease very little is known about global gene expression for human astrocytes. We have performed a microarray expression analysis of human fetal astrocytes to identify genes and signaling pathways that are important for astrocyte development and maintenance. Our analysis confirmed that the fetal astrocytes express high levels of the core astrocyte marker GFAP and the transcription factors from the NFI family which have been shown to play important roles in astrocyte development. A group of novel markers were identified that distinguish fetal astrocytes from pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSCs) and NSC-derived neurons. As in murine astrocytes, the Notch signaling pathway appears to be particularly important for cell fate decisions between the astrocyte and neuronal lineages in human astrocytes. These findings unveil the repertoire of genes expressed in human astrocytes and serve as a basis for further studies to better understand astrocyte biology, especially as it relates to disease."

          "abstract": "Astrocytes are ubiquitous in the brain and have multiple functions. It is becoming clear that they play an important role in monitoring the neuromicroenvironment, information processing, and signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) in normal conditions and that they respond to CNS injuries. During the development of the CNS, astrocytes play a key role as a substrate for neuronal migration and axonal growth. To identify genes that could participate in astrocyte maturation, we used the differential display reverse transcription-PCR (DDRT-PCR) method. Human fetal astrocytes were cultured and total RNAs were isolated at intervals of 5 days for 50 days. Using 24 primer combinations, we identified a set of 18 candidate cDNAs deriving from the excised DDRT-PCR bands. DNA sequencing revealed 16 genes that have been described already. We found that RTP, TG, hTM-alpha, SPARC, TRIP7, and RPL7 genes were expressed increasingly, while HMGCR, RPL27a, NACA, NPM, and TARBP2 genes were expressed decreasingly, according to their culture stages. We also found two unidentified genes, A3 and C8, which were expressed differently in culture stages; the former was expressed decreasingly and the latter increasingly. These two genes were found in the same amount in genomic DNA from various human cells such as astrocytes, astrocytoma, trophoblasts and lymphocytes. The A3 gene was found only in human genomic DNA, but not in rat (ATr5), mouse (RAW264.7), or monkey (Vero) cells, whereas the C8 gene was found in human genomic DNA and monkey cells, but not in rat or mouse cells. We analysed these two genes for identification. There was >92% nucleotide sequence identity between the A3 gene (3,626 bp) and the Homo sapiens general transcription factor 3 (GTF3), and >96% nucleotide sequence identity between the C8 gene (2,401 bp) and the transmembrane receptor Unc5h2.

Upon induction of NSEHip2-28 differentiation, at a time when glial fibrillary acidic protein expression became detectable, the expression of all four Id family members initially increased dramatically, and subsequently decreased. Furthermore, varying levels of Id gene expression were found in astroglial tumor cell lines displaying variable degrees of lineage-specific differentiation.

We report here that NFAT4 is expressed in U373 astrocytoma cells and in primary cultures of astrocytes. Treatment of U373 cells or primary astrocytes with the calcium ionophore A23187, or the neurotransmitter glutamate, leads to NFAT nuclear translocation and increased DNA binding to a NFAT consensus site through a cyclosporin A-sensitive process. These data suggest that NFAT4 functions as a calcium-responsive transcription factor in astrocytes."

At the site of neuroinflammation, astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines play both neuroprotective and neurotoxic roles in brain lesions of human neurological diseases. At present, the comprehensive profile of human astrocyte-derived cytokines and chemokines during inflammation remains to be fully characterized. We investigated the cytokine secretome profile of highly purified human astrocytes by using a protein microarray. Non-stimulated human astrocytes in culture expressed eight cytokines, including G-CSF, GM-CSF, GROα (CXCL1), IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), MCP-1 (CCL2), MIF and Serpin E1. Following stimulation with IL-1β and TNF-α, activated astrocytes newly produced IL-1β, IL-1ra, TNF-α, IP-10 (CXCL10), MIP-1α (CCL3) and RANTES (CCL5), in addition to the induction of sICAM-1 and complement component 5. Database search indicated that most of cytokines and chemokines produced by non-stimulated and activated astrocytes are direct targets of the transcription factor NF-kB. These results indicated that cultured human astrocytes express a distinct set of NF-kB-target cytokines and chemokines in resting and activated conditions, suggesting that the NF-kB signaling pathway differentially regulates gene expression of cytokines and chemokines in human astrocytes under physiological and inflammatory conditions."

Despite this assumption, the observed uniformity in cancer rates across species, referred to as the Peto's paradox, presents a conundrum. Recognizing that tumour progression is not solely dependent on cancer cells but involves intricate interactions among various cell types, this study employed a Lotka-Volterra (LV) ordinary differential equation model to analyze the evolution of cancerous cells and the cancer incidence in an immune environment. As a result, this study uncovered the sufficient conditions underlying the absence of correlation in Peto's paradox and provide insights into the reasons for the equitable distribution of cancer incidence across diverse species by applying nondimensionalization and drawing an analogy between the characteristic time interval for the variation of cell populations in the ODE model and that of cell cycles of a species."

It prompts investigations into how species with traits that theoretically increase cancer risk manage to exhibit cancer resistance, with the ultimate goal of uncovering novel therapies for humans. Building on these foundational insights, we propose expanding the research focus to species that, despite possessing traits beyond size and longevity that theoretically increase their cancer risk, exhibit unexpected cancer resistance. Testing Peto's paradox without interference from transient dynamics also requires considering species that are at an equilibrium between cancer risks and defenses, which is increasingly challenging due to anthropogenic activities. Additionally, we argue that transmissible cancers could significantly help in understanding how the metastatic process might be naturally suppressed. This research perspective is timely and aims to support the continued and in-depth identification of anti-cancer adaptations retained throughout evolution in the animal kingdom."

          "abstract": "Larger, longer-lived species are expected to have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller, shorter-lived species owing to the greater number of cell divisions that occur during their lifespan. Yet, to date, no evidence has been found to support this expectation, and no association has been found between cancer prevalence and body size across species-a phenomenon known as Peto's paradox. Specifically, while anticancer mechanisms have been identified for individual species, wider phylogenetic evidence has remained elusive. Here, we show that there is no evidence for Peto's paradox across amphibians, birds, mammals, and squamate reptiles: Larger species do in fact have a higher cancer prevalence compared to smaller species. Moreover, we demonstrate that the accumulation of repeated instances of accelerated body size evolution in mammals and birds is associated with a reduction in the prevalence of neoplasia and malignancy, suggesting that increased rates of body size evolution are associated with the evolution of improved cellular growth control. These results represent empirical evidence showing that larger body size is related to higher cancer prevalence, thus rejecting Peto's paradox, and demonstrating the importance of heterogenous routes of body size evolution in shaping anticancer defenses."

          "abstract": "Cancer, one of the leading health concerns for humans, is by no means a human-unique malady. Accumulating evidence shows that cancer kills domestic and wild animals at a similar rate to humans and can even pose a conservation threat to certain species. Assuming that each physiologically active and proliferating cell is at risk of malignant transformation, any evolutionary increase in the number of cells (and thus body mass) will lead to a higher cancer frequency, all else being equal. However, available data fail to support the prediction that bigger animals are affected by cancer more than smaller ones. The unexpected lack of correlation between body size (and life span) and cancer risk across taxa was dubbed Peto's paradox. In this perspective, several plausible explanations of Peto's paradox are presented, with the emphasis on a largely underappreciated relation of cell size to both metabolism and cell division rates across species, which we believe are key factors underlying the paradox. We conclude that larger organisms have bigger and slowly dividing cells with lower energy turnover, all significantly reducing the risk of cancer initiation. Solving Peto's paradox will enhance our understanding the evolution of cancer and may provide new implications for cancer prevention and treatment."

          "abstract": "The frequency of cancer is postulated to be proportional to the number of cells an animal possesses, as each cell is similarly exposed to mutagens with every cell division. Larger animals result from more cell divisions with more mutagenic exposure, and hence are expected to have higher frequencies of cancer. Yet, as stipulated by Peto's paradox, larger animals do not have the higher rates of cancers seen in smaller animals despite the significant differences in cell numbers and a longer lifetime that would expose larger animals to more mutagens. The rates of cancer appear to be inversely proportional to animal body size, which scales inversely with specific metabolic rates of mammals. Studies over the past 20 years have linked oncogenes and tumour suppressors to alterations in cancer metabolism, and conversely, mutations in metabolic genes have been documented to trigger tumorigenesis. The by-products and intermediates of metabolism, such as reactive oxygen species, oxoglutarate, citrate and acetate, all have the potential to mutate and alter the genome or epigenome. On the basis of these general observations, it is proposed that metabolic rates correlate with mutagenic rates, which are higher in small animals and give the mechanistic basis for Peto's paradox. The observations discussed in this overview collectively indicate that specific metabolic rate varies inversely with body size, which seems to support the hypothesis that metabolism drives tumorigenesis and accounts for Peto's paradox."

The leading hypothesis to explain this pattern is natural selection for differential cancer prevention in larger, longer lived species. We evaluate whether a similar effect exists within species, specifically humans. We begin by reanalysing a recently published dataset to separate the effects of stem cell number and replication rate, and show that each has an independent effect on cancer risk. When considering the lifetime number of stem cell divisions in an extended dataset, and removing cases associated with other diseases or carcinogens, we find that lifetime cancer risk per tissue saturates at approximately 0.3-1.3% for the types considered. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most of the remaining variation. Our results indicate that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions but varies enormously (approx. 10 000 times) depending on anatomical site. We conclude that variation in risk of human cancer types is analogous to the paradoxical lack of variation in cancer incidence among animal species and may likewise be understood as a result of evolution by natural selection."

          "abstract": "Elucidation of tumour suppression mechanisms is a major challenge in cancer biology. Therefore, Peto's paradox, or low cancer incidence in large animals, has attracted focus. According to the gene-abundance hypothesis, which considers the increase/decrease in cancer-related genes with body size, researchers evaluated the associations between gene abundance and body size. However, previous studies only focused on a few specific gene functions and have ignored the alternative hypothesis (metabolic rate hypothesis): in this hypothesis, the cellular metabolic rate and subsequent oxidative stress decreases with increasing body size. In this study, we have elected to explore the gene-abundance hypothesis taking into account the metabolic rate hypothesis. Thus, we comprehensively investigated the correlation between the number of genes in various functional categories and body size while at the same time correcting for the mass-specific metabolic rate (<i>B</i><sub>c</sub>). A number of gene functions that correlated with body size were initially identified, but they were found to be artefactual due to the decrease in <i>B</i><sub>c</sub> with increasing body size. By contrast, immune system-related genes were found to increase with increasing body size when the correlation included this correction for <i>B</i><sub>c</sub>. These findings support the gene-abundance hypothesis and emphasize the importance of also taking into account the metabolic rate when evaluating gene abundance-body size relationships. This finding may be useful for understanding cancer evolution and tumour suppression mechanisms as well as for determining cancer-related genes and functions."

          "abstract": "Peto's paradox is the counterintuitive finding that increasing body mass and thereby cell number does not correlate with an increase in cancer incidence across different species. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved system that determines organ size by regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation. It also affects cell growth by microRNA-29 (miR-29)-mediated cross-talk to the mTOR signaling pathway. Whether these pathways that decide organ size could explain this paradox merits consideration. Inactivation of most genes of the Hippo pathway in Drosophila melanogaster genetic screens causes excessive tissue-specific growth of developing tissues. Altered Hippo pathway activity is frequently found in diverse tumor types, but mutations of component pathway genes are rare. Most Hippo pathway components are encoded by tumor suppressor genes (TSG), but an exception is the downstream effector gene called YAP. Activity of the Hippo pathway causes deactivating phosphorylation of YES-associated protein (YAP) with nuclear exclusion. YAP can also be phosphorylated at a second site, S127, by AKT. YAP induces the expression of genes responsible for proliferation and suppression of apoptosis. Resolving Peto's paradox may serendipitously provide new insights into the biology and treatment of cancer. This article considers Hippo signaling and Peto's paradox in the context of TSG-oncogene computed models. Interspecies differences in dietary composition, metabolic rates, and anabolic processes are also discussed in the context of Hippo-mTOR signaling. The metabolically important LKB1-AMPK (liver kinase B1-AMP activated protein kinase) signaling axis that suppresses the mTOR pathway is also considered."

Five hypotheses potentially resolving this paradox were modeled using the multistage model of carcinogenesis. The five hypotheses were based on (1) intrinsic changes in metabolic rate with body size; adaptive increase in immune policing of (2) cancer cells or (3) cells with driver mutations; or adaptive increase in cancer suppression via (4) decreased somatic mutation rate, or (5) increased genetic control. Parameter changes needed to stabilize cancer risk in three types of cancer were estimated for tissues scaled from mouse size and longevity to human and blue whale levels. The metabolic rate hypothesis alone was rejected due to a conflict between the required interspecific effect with the observed intraspecific effect of size on cancer risk, but some metabolic change was optionally incorporated in the other models. Necessary parameter changes in immune policing and somatic mutation rate far exceeded values observed; however, natural selection increasing the genetic suppression of cancer was generally consistent with data. Such adaptive increases in genetic control of cancers in large and/or long-lived animals raise the possibility that nonmodel animals will reveal novel anticancer mechanisms."

          "abstract": "Production of hydrogen by anaerobes, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, methylotrophs, and photosynthetic bacteria is possible. Anaerobic Clostridia are potential producers and immobilized C. butyricum produces 2 mol H2/mol glucose at 50% efficiency. Spontaneous production of H2 from formate and glucose by immobilized Escherichia coli showed 100% and 60% efficiencies, respectively. Enterobactericiae produces H2 at similar efficiency from different monosaccharides during growth. Among methylotrophs, methanogenes, rumen bacteria, and thermophilic archae, Ruminococcus albus, is promising (2.37 mol/mol glucose). Immobilized aerobic Bacillus licheniformis optimally produces 0.7 mol H2/mol glucose. Photosynthetic Rhodospirillum rubrum produces 4, 7, and 6 mol of H2 from acetate, succinate, and malate, respectively. Excellent productivity (6.2 mol H2/mol glucose) by co-cultures of Cellulomonas with a hydrogenase uptake (Hup) mutant of R. capsulata on cellulose was found. Cyanobacteria, viz., Anabaena, Synechococcus, and Oscillatoria sp., have been studied for photoproduction of H2. Immobilized A. cylindrica produces H2 (20 ml/g dry wt/h) continually for 1 year. Increased H2 productivity was found for Hup mutant of A. variabilis. Synechococcus sp. has a high potential for H2 production in fermentors and outdoor cultures. Simultaneous productions of oxychemicals and H2 by Klebseilla sp. and by enzymatic methods were also attempted. The fate of H2 biotechnology is presumed to be dictated by the stock of fossil fuel and state of pollution in future."

These drugs have received special attention because they decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and slow progression of diabetic kidney disease (1-3). Balanced against these impressive benefits, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved prescribing information describes a long list of side effects: genitourinary infections, ketoacidosis, bone fractures, amputations, acute kidney injury, perineal necrotizing fasciitis, and hyperkalemia.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors medications lower plasma glucose by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubule of the kidney independent of insulin. Furthermore, they reduce intraglomerular pressure by restoring tubuloglomerular feedback. Large cardiovascular outcome trials of both empagliflozin and canagliflozin have consistently shown beneficial kidney effects that go beyond glycaemic control, such as reducing risk for incident nephropathy and progression of chronic kidney disease. The mechanisms by which sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors improve kidney outcomes are not clear. Proposed hypotheses underpinning the kidney benefits include kidney-specific effects such as decreased intraglomerular pressure, activation of angiotensin-(1-7) and the Mas receptor leading to decreased inflammation, decrease in overall kidney oxygen consumption, rise in erythropoietin levels, inhibition of the renal sodium-hydrogen exchanger and secondary kidney effects related to improvements in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and blood pressure. This review will focus on describing the mechanisms of action of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the kidney, clinical efficacy data on their use in patients with chronic kidney disease, postulated physiologic underpinnings of kidney protection observed with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors and the promise and potential pitfalls for their use in patients with chronic kidney disease."

Here we review the epidemiology, virulence mechanisms, and host response to the most frequently isolated Gram-positive uropathogens: Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus agalactiae. We also review several emerging, rare, misclassified, and otherwise underreported Gram-positive pathogens of the urinary tract including Aerococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobaculum, and Gardnerella. The literature strongly suggests that urologic diseases involving Gram-positive bacteria may be easily overlooked due to limited culture-based assays typically utilized for urine in hospital microbiology laboratories. Some UTIs are polymicrobial in nature, often involving one or more Gram-positive bacteria. We herein review the risk factors and recent evidence for mechanisms of bacterial synergy in experimental models of polymicrobial UTI. Recent experimental data has demonstrated that, despite being cleared quickly from the bladder, some Gram-positive bacteria can impact pathogenic outcomes of co-infecting organisms. When taken together, the available evidence argues that Gram-positive bacteria are important uropathogens in their own right, but that some can be easily overlooked because they are missed by routine diagnostic methods. Finally, a growing body of evidence demonstrates that a surprising variety of fastidious Gram-positive bacteria may either reside in or be regularly exposed to the urinary tract and further suggests that their presence is widespread among women, as well as men. Experimental studies in this area are needed; however, there is a growing appreciation that the composition of bacteria found in the bladder could be a potentially important determinant in urologic disease, including susceptibility to UTI."

Uropathogenic Escherichia coli are the most common cause of urinary tract infection. Type 1 fimbriated E. coli have been associated with cystitis, and P fimbriated E. coli with pyelonephritis. Factors involved in clearing bacteria from the urinary tract are poorly understood. Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), the most abundant protein in mammalian urine, has been postulated to play a role in defense against urinary tract infection but definitive proof for this idea has been lacking. In this study, we generated THP gene knockout mice by the technique of homologous recombination, and examined if the THP-deficient (THP-/-) mice were more prone to urinary tract infection. Various strains of E. coli expressing type 1 or P fimbriae were introduced transurethrally into the bladders of the THP-/- and genetically similar wild-type (THP+/+) mice. Urine, bladder, and kidney tissues were obtained from the mice and cultured for bacterial growth. THP-/- mice inoculated with type 1 fimbriated E. coli had a longer duration of bacteriuria, and more intense colonization of the urinary bladder in comparison with THP+/+ mice. When inoculated with a P fimbriated strain of E. coli, the THP-/- mice showed no difference in kidney bacterial load when compared with the THP+/+ mice. These findings support the idea that THP serves as a soluble receptor for type 1 fimbriated E. coli and helps eliminate bacteria from the urinary tract."

A vast amount of literature regarding the mechanisms through which E. coli induces pyelonephritis has accumulated. Although cystitis accounts for 95% of visits to physicians for symptoms of urinary tract infections, few in vivo studies have investigated possible differences between E. coli recovered from patients with clinical symptoms of cystitis and that from patients with symptoms of pyelonephritis. Epidemiological studies indicate that cystitis-associated strains appear to differ from pyelonephritis-associated strains in elaboration of some putative virulence factors. With transurethrally challenged mice we studied possible differences using three each of the most virulent pyelonephritis and cystitis E. coli strains in our collection. The results indicate that cystitis strains colonize the bladder more rapidly than do pyelonephritis strains, while the rates of kidney colonization are similar. Cystitis strains colonize the bladder in higher numbers, induce more pronounced histologic changes in the bladder, and are more rapidly eliminated from the mouse urinary tract than pyelonephritis strains. These results provide evidence that cystitis strains differ from pyelonephritis strains in this model, that this model is useful for the study of the uropathogenicity of cystitis strains, and that it would be unwise to use pyelonephritis strains to study putative virulence factors important in the development of cystitis."

Proteus mirabilis expresses several types of fimbriae that could be involved in the pathogenesis of UTI, including uroepithelial cell adhesin (UCA). In this report, we used an uropathogenic P. mirabilis wild-type strain and an isogenic ucaA mutant unable to express UCA to study the pathogenic role of this fimbria in UTI. Ability of the mutant to adhere to desquamated uroepithelial cells and to infect mice using different experimental UTI models was significantly impaired.

Despite being a facultative anaerobe, uropathogenic Escherichia coli, the primary cause of urinary tract infections, requires aerobic respiration to establish infection in the bladder. Here, by combining bacterial genetics with cell culture and murine models of infection, we demonstrate that the widely conserved respiratory quinol oxidase cytochrome bd is required for intracellular infection of urothelial cells. Through a series of genetic, biochemical and functional assays, we show that intracellular oxygen scavenging by cytochrome bd alters mitochondrial physiology by reducing the efficiency of mitochondrial respiration, stabilizing the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 and promoting a shift towards aerobic glycolysis. This bacterially induced rewiring of host metabolism antagonizes apoptosis, thereby protecting intracellular bacteria from urothelial cell exfoliation and preserving their replicative niche. These results reveal the metabolic basis for intracellular bacterial pathogenesis during urinary tract infection and identify subversion of mitochondrial metabolism as a bacterial strategy to facilitate persistence within the urinary tract."

          "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections and are predominantly caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). While UTIs are typically considered extracellular infections, it has been recently demonstrated that UPEC bind to, invade, and replicate within the murine bladder urothelium to form intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs). These IBCs dissociate and bacteria flux out of bladder facet cells, some with filamentous morphology, and ultimately establish quiescent intracellular reservoirs that can seed recurrent infection. This IBC pathogenic cycle has not yet been investigated in humans. In this study we sought to determine whether evidence of an IBC pathway could be found in urine specimens from women with acute UTI. We collected midstream, clean-catch urine specimens from 80 young healthy women with acute uncomplicated cystitis and 20 asymptomatic women with a history of UTI. Investigators were blinded to culture results and clinical history. Samples were analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy for evidence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria. Evidence of IBCs was found in 14 of 80 (18%) urines from women with UTI. Filamentous bacteria were found in 33 of 80 (41%) urines from women with UTI. None of the 20 urines from the asymptomatic comparative group showed evidence of IBCs or filaments. Filamentous bacteria were present in all 14 of the urines with IBCs compared to 19 (29%) of 66 samples with no evidence of IBCs (p < 0.001). Of 65 urines from patients with E. coli infections, 14 (22%) had evidence of IBCs and 29 (45%) had filamentous bacteria, while none of the gram-positive infections had IBCs or filamentous bacteria. The presence of exfoliated IBCs and filamentous bacteria in the urines of women with acute cystitis suggests that the IBC pathogenic pathway characterized in the murine model may occur in humans. The findings support the occurrence of an intracellular bacterial niche in some women with cystitis that may have important implications for UTI recurrence and treatment."

While probiotics have been much researched, better understanding of the probiotic effects and applications of species such as Bacillus clausii is warranted. In this narrative literature review, we review the characteristics and mechanisms of action supporting B. clausii as a probiotic and discuss the evidence from clinical studies evaluating B. clausii probiotics for the management of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders and symptoms in children and adults. Finally, we highlight the challenges of future research and the need for more robust and diverse clinical evidence to guide physicians in the clinical application of probiotics for gastrointestinal disorders and other conditions."

          "abstract": "<i>Bacillus clausii</i> is a commercial spore probiotic known to treat multiple diseases. An increased interest in exploring the nutraceutical and probiotic properties of various microorganisms has made researchers explore more about these bacteria. The current trends in the healthcare industry are majorly focused on devising new therapies to avoid drug and pathogen resistance in patients. Antimicrobial peptides have been considered a source of antibiotics for a long time. Still, getting new therapies into the market is a big challenge. Members of the genus Bacillus have been reported to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial peptides. One of the least explored species under this genus is <i>Bacillus clausii</i>, concerning peptide drug therapy. The applications of <i>Bacillus clausii</i> in treating or preventing gut dysbiosis and respiratory infections have been largely supported in the past two decades. Yet research is lacking in explaining the pathways at molecular levels in targeting pathogens. In this mini-review, we are going to summarise the research that has been reported so far about peptide extraction from <i>Bacillus clausii</i>, their mode of action and advantages to mankind, and the challenges lying in the isolation of peptides."

          "abstract": "Probiotics contain beneficial live bacteria that confer several health benefits to the host. For the past 50 years, spore-forming Bacillus species have been used in the form of probiotics. Among these, Bacillus clausii strains are used for the management of acute and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. In the present work, we have evaluated the asserted label information on randomly chosen commercial Bacillus clausii spore suspension of probiotic products. The quality and number of viable bacteria were evaluated based on the colony count, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic activity assays. The colony fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene-sequencing techniques were used to confirm the presence of a univariate strain (Bacillus clausii). Our results corroborated the label count of 2 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/5 mL in BACIPRO®, ENTEROGERMINA®, and TUFPRO® products. However, vegetative spore count was not found to match with the given label count in BENEGUT®, PROALANA-B®, β-LOCK®, and PROCILLUS® Bacillus clausii brands. In the hemolytic activity assay, except for β-LOCK®, the other 6 products showed gamma-hemolysis activity. Bacillus clausii isolated from all 7 probiotic products demonstrated resistance to several broad-spectrum antibiotics. The 16S rRNA gene-sequencing data detected genera of Bacillus and Bacillus clausii strain in the BACIPRO®, ENTEROGERMINA®, PROALANA-B®, BENEGUT®, and TUFPRO® products; however, Ralstonia mannitolilytica and Paenibacillus dendritiformis species were identified in β-LOCK® and PROCILLUS®, respectively. As correct label information was observed only in BACIPRO®, ENTEROGERMINA®, and TUFPRO® products, it is proposed that a more stringent quality check would minimize the possibility of mismatch concerning the label information."

          "abstract": "Bacillus clausii SIN is one of the four strains of B. clausii composing a probiotic administered to humans for the prevention of gastrointestinal side effects due to oral antibiotic therapy. The strain is resistant to kanamycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. A gene conferring aminoglycoside resistance was cloned into Escherichia coli and sequenced. The gene, called aadD2, encoding a putative 246-amino acid protein, shared 47% identity with ant(4')-Ia from Staphylococcus aureus, which encodes an aminoglycoside 4'-O-nucleotidyltransferase. Phosphocellulose paper-binding assays indicated that the gene product was responsible for nucleotidylation of kanamycin, tobramycin, and amikacin. The aadD2 gene was detected by DNA-DNA hybridization in the three other strains of the probiotic mixture and in the reference strain B. clausii DSM8716, although it did not confer resistance in these strains. Mutations in the sequence of the putative promoter for aadD2 from B. clausii SIN resulted in higher identity with consensus promoter sequences and may account for aminoglycoside resistance in that strain. The aadD2 gene was chromosomally located in all strains and was not transferable by conjugation. These data indicate that chromosomal aadD2 is specific to B. clausii."

          "abstract": "Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in young children. Bacillus clausii (B. clausii) is a spore-forming probiotic that is able to colonize the gut. A mixture of four B. clausii strains (O/C, T, SIN and N/R) is commonly used for the treatment of AGE, and it has been demonstrated that it can reduce the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with AGE. Few studies have sought to characterize the mechanisms responsible for such beneficial effects. Intestinal effects of probiotics are likely to be strain-specific. We conducted a series of in vitro experiments investigating the activities of this mixture of B. clausii strains on biomarkers of mucosal barrier integrity and immune function in a cellular model of Rotavirus infection. B. clausii protected enterocytes against Rotavirus-induced decrease in trans-epithelial electrical resistance, and up-regulated expression of mucin 5AC and tight junction proteins (occludin and zonula occludens-1), all of which are important for effective mucosal barrier function. B. clausii also inhibited reactive oxygen species production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-8 and interferon-β) in Rotavirus-infected cells, and down-regulated pro-inflammatory Toll-like receptor 3 pathway gene expression. Such mechanisms likely contributed to the observed protective effects of B. clausii against reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in Rotavirus-infected enterocytes."

To date, there are few reports of complications secondary to this agent in pediatric patients. To describe the case of an infant who developed after treatment sepsis due to Bacillus clausii. A 4-month-old female infant of indigenous ethnicity, from a rural area in the interior of Panama, 3 hours away from the nearest health sub-center by canoe, and with protein-calorie malnutrition, presented with acute diarrhea and moderate-severe dehydration, receiving Enterogermina as part of the initial treatment. She was transferred to a tertiary hospital, where she arrived with impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, and signs of shock. The initial blood culture reported growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the gastrointestinal panel was positive for Clostridiodes difficile, and later serial blood cultures of peripheral blood and central venous catheter confirmed growth of Bacillus clausii. With a torpid evolution and resistance to multiple antibiotic schemes, she died due to multisystem organ failure twelve days after admission. The use of probiotics as concomitant treatment in patients with some degree of immunosuppression should be administered with caution, considering the presence of risk criteria for complications such as malnutrition or intestinal epithelial damage due to severe diarrhea since they predispose to the development of bacteremia and/or sepsis."

We report the composite genome of Bacillus clausii ENTPro from a commercially available probiotic Enterogermina® and compare it with the genomes of other Bacillus probiotics. We find that the members of B. clausii species harbor high heterogeneity at the species as well as genus level. The genes conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, rifampicin, and tetracycline in the B. clausii ENTPro strain could be identified. The genes coding for the bacteriocin gallidermin, which prevents biofilm formation in the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis, were also identified. KEGG Pathway analysis suggested that the folate biosynthesis pathway, which depicts one of the important roles of probiotics in the host, is conserved completely in B. subtilis and minimally in B. clausii and other probiotics. We identified various antibiotic resistance, bacteriocins, stress-related, and adhesion-related domains, and industrially-relevant pathways, in the genomes of these probiotic bacteria that are likely to help them survive in the harsh gastrointestinal tract, facilitating adhesion to host epithelial cells, persistence during antibiotic treatment and combating bacterial infections."

Possible factors, such as time of day of chlamydia infection on chlamydial pathogenesis has not been determined. We hypothesised that infections during the day, will cause increased complications compared to infections at night. Mice placed under normal 12:12 light: dark (LD) cycle were infected intravaginally with Chlamydia muridarum either at zeitgeber time 3, ZT3 and ZT15. Infectivity was monitored by periodic vaginal swabs and chlamydiae isolation. Blood and vaginal washes were collected for host immunologic response assessments. The reproductive tracts of the mice were examined histopathologically, and fertility was determined by embryo enumeration after mating. Mice infected at ZT3 shed significantly more C. muridarum than mice infected at ZT15. This correlated with the increased genital tract pathology observed in mice infected at ZT3. Mice infected at ZT3 were less fertile than mice infected at ZT15. The results suggest that the time of day of infection influences chlamydial pathogenesis, it indicates a possible association between complications from chlamydia infection and host circadian clock, which may lead to a better understanding of chlamydial pathogenesis."

The sensitivity of self-collected vaginal (introital) samples to diagnose genital infections by Chlamydia trachomatis using Roche AMPLICOR CT/NG PCR was compared with the cervical- and first-voided urine samples from women consulting with- (Group 1; n=123) and without (Group 0; n=160) genital symptoms. Women were interviewed regarding genital hygiene. Genital symptoms and signs were noted. C. trachomatis DNA was detected in 13.0% of women from Group 1 and in 5.0% of women from Group 0, i.e. in urine of 6.5% vs. 1.9%, in the cervical swab in 9.8% vs. 5.0% and in vaginal swab in 11.4% vs. 3.8% of women, respectively.

C. trachomatis was less often detected in urine of women who routinely practised genital washing.
